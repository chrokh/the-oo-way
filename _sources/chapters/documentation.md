# Documentation

```{warning}
Work in progress.

Whenever we write any non-trivial piece of software we tend to write, generate, or in other ways deal with a number of different types of documents.
Different types of documents have different purposes.
In this chapter we're giving a brief overview of the document types that we'll discuss in this book.

% Voluminous documentation is part of the problem, not part of the solution.

%In the chapter on {doc}`documentation` we discussed four types of documents:
%requirements, design, technical, and end-user documents.
%Code comments can be used for any of these four purposes.
%Whether comments *should* be used for all four is a different question.
