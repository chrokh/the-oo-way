# TODO

- Data types
  - Expand discussion in Data Types chapter on why treating Nullable warnings as errors is a good idea and that this should be the default.
  - Have I emphasized the importance of null reference static analysis enough?
- Compilation
  - Compiler warnings in Compilation chapter.
- General
  - Reintroduce error code in prefix of printed errors.
  - There is no information on what "keyword" means.
- Sets
  - Sets chapter needs to descibre Union.
- Variables
  - Variables chapter missing image placeholders.
- Labs
  - Brute-force hangman. Computer does guessing. You input how long the word should be and the program already has a word list stored.
  - Smart hangman. Like simple hangman but guessing computer uses word list and probability theory to make the best guesses.
