    "# Abstract injected object composition\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Prerequisites\n",
    ":class: info\n",
    "In this chapter weâ€™re exploring the object composition abstraction level that we refer to as \"abstract constructed object composition\". Please have a look at the chapter [object composition](object-composition:abstraction-levels) if you have not already.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is time.\n",
    "We are finally ready to talk about abstraction depdendency injection.\n",
    "This is the creme de la creme in object oriented programming.\n",
    "%Where we use subtype polymoprhism to its fullest capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "With abstract injected object composition we are able to swap out both types and values at run-time.\n",
    "Meaning that we don't couple to any particular concrete implementation or type at compile-time.\n",
    "This makes our code [decoupled](coupling) and increases [maintainability](maintainability).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see in one of the examples, abstract injected object composition enables us to follow the maxim [composition over inheritance](composition-over-inheritance).\n",
    "As if that wasn't enough, almost all [design patterns](design-patterns) are, in one way or another, using abstract injected object composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enough motivation, let's get in to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "An object composition is abstract if the compile-time type of the composed object is abstract.\n",
    "It is injected if the composed object is constructed outside of the composing object and instead passed into it (via the constructor, a method, or property).\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: Actually it could be injected through a public field as well no?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, we've discussed the notion of [injection](injection) in the chapter on [concrete injected object composition](concrete-injected-object-composition).\n",
    "But in short, the idea is that insted of instantiating the object ourselves, we let someone else be responsible for instantiating that object and then passing it to us.\n",
    "Instead of, for example, having a constructor that accepts some parameters that I'm going to use to instantiate some object, I simply use the type of that object as the parameter type.\n",
    "Instead of asking others to send me some data so that I can instantiate an object, I simply ask them for the object instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "Instead of instantiating the dependency ourselves, we simply parameterize a method or a constructor so that callers can pass the dependency.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly though, now we're talking about *abstract* injected object composition.\n",
    "Which means that the compile-time type of the composed object *must* be abstract.\n",
    "Meaning, must be an [interface](interfaces) or an [abstract class](abstract-classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Substitution ciphers\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's replace [inheritance](inheritance) with composition.\n",
    "Remember how we've struggled, in the chapters on [methods](methods), [inheritance](inheritance), and [abstract classes](abstract-classes) to get rid of the duplicated `foreach` loop in substitution ciphers.\n",
    "The loop that iterates over an input `string`, calls a method that takes a `char` and depending on the cipher returns a `char` or a `string`, and then concatenates the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem has been that some ciphers, like the Caesar cipher, returns a `char` when encoding a `char`, while others, like the Robber's language, returns a `string` when encoding a `char`.\n",
    "Well, when we're using composition rather than inheritance, this is no longer a big deal.\n",
