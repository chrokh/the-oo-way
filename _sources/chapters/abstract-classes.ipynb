    "% TODO: Must mention that abstract classes still can have constructors!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstract classes\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to use [inheritance](inheritance) for purposes of code reuse but we don't want it to be possible to instantiate the superclass.\n",
    "Sometimes it just doesn't make sense to have instances of the super class on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's as if we would like to use an [interface](interfaces) but find that if we do then we have to duplicate some code that we could otherwise reuse through inheritance.\n",
    "Granted, at this point, all your smoke sensors should be sounding.\n",
    "In a later chapter we will talk about the design principle [composition over inheritance](composition-over-inheritance).\n",
    "You probably should solve this problem with composition rather than inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we have not yet discussed composition over inheritance which often relies on [abstract injected object composition](abstract-injected-object-composition) which we also haven't talked about, let's instead talk about how we can solve this using abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class is similar to an [interface](interfaces) in the sense that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* it cannot be instantiated, and\n",
    "* it can declare signatures of members that its inheritors must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract is similar to a class in the sense that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* it can contain members with implementations that it's inheritors will inherit (and not just signatures).\n",
    "\n",
    "In an abstract class we can mark any combination of its (public) members as `abstract`.\n",
    "It is legal to mark all of them as well as none of them as `abstract`.\n",
    "If they are marked as `abstract` then that means that they cannot have any implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: Any of its non-private, non-sealed members??\n",
    "\n",
    "Any member marked as `abstract` must be [overridden](overriding) in all non-abstract classes that inherit from the abstract class.\n",
    "We emphasize the word *non-abstract* since abstract classes of course may inherit from abstract classes.\n",
    "Only when we reach a non-abstract class must we start implementing the abstract members.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C# we can declare that a class is abstract by simply prepending the word `abstract` before the keyword `class` but after any [access modifiers](access-modifiers).\n",
    "In C# we can declare that a method is abstract by prepending the word `abstract` before the return type but after any [access modifiers](access-modifiers).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characterwise ciphers\n",
    "\n",
    "%TODO: MOTIVATION: FOR LISKOV CHAPTER. DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR OTHER CIPHERS TO INHERIT FROM NULLCIPHER? PROBABLY NOT RIGHT?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter on [inheritance](inheritance:examples:characterwise) we discussed back and forth about the usefulness of the implementation in the superclass `CharWiseCipher` which we later renamed to `CharToCharSubstitutionCipher`.\n",
    "Now that we know about abstract classes it is possible for us to avoid having to even think about this by making that base class abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "How come we don't have to think about it?\n",
    "Well, if we mark the base class as abstract then we can be sure that there will never be any instances of that class floating around.\n",
    "Also, since we then can mark any of its members as abstract, we don't actually have to implement the method `char Encode (char input)`, meaning the method that takes and produces a `char`.\n",
    "That method was our main concern in the example on [inheritance](inheritance:examples:characterwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's try to simply mark it as abstract.\n",
    "This time we'll call the class `CharToCharSubstitutionCipher`."
