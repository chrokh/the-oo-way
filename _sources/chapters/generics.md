%Parametric polymorphism.
%
%- Type constructor
%- Type parameter
%- Type parameter constraints
%
%- Bound types
%- Unbound types

%- Example: Identity cipher can be implemented from A -> A. So that we don't need an identity cipher for chars. Actually this is not possible for char cipher since it is char -> string. Possible with constraints?
