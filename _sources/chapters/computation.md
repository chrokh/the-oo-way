# Computation

```{warning}
This chapter is a work in progress.

Executing the steps of an algorithm [{numref}`Chapter %s<algorithms>`] is to compute.
Since algorithms were around long before what we today think of as computers, computation is much older than computers.
To make the distinction clearer we could also use the term computer hardware instead of simply computers.


## History

- The word "computer" was originally used to refer to a human responsible for carrying out computation.
- The earliest computing devices were used for simple tallying and recording quantities {cite:p}`todo`.
This was often done in a way similar to how we count on our fingers.
- The earliest tool that we know have been used for arithmetic computation is the abacus, also known as a counting frame {cite:p}`todo`.
While calculators are usually used today, abacuses are still produced today albeit sometimes as children's toys.
A modern abacus might be made from a wooden frame with metal wires on which you can slide wooden beads back and forth.
See {numref}`fig:abacus` for an illustration.

- Antikythera mechanism.
- Planisphere, sector, planimeter, slide rule.
- The devices became more and more advanced and involves more and more complex mechanics.
- Charles Babbage, Jaquard looms, and the difference engine. Never completed in his own lifetime but later completed by his son.
- From analog computers, electromechanical, to vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits.
- Concept of modern computer proposed by Alan Turing as "Universal computing machine".
- Turing Also proposes stored programs instead of fixed programs.
- Concepts of Turing complete is still used today.
- Manchester baby.
- Transistors.
