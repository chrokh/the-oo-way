    "# Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: UML class diagrams. Specification says use <<Create>> but it's also common to just use the same name and return type as the class.\n",
    "% TODO: Benefits are very similar to partial application when we send in data through the constructor. Our data depends on the state of the object. Being able to store some data in an instance and then use objects of the same type interchangably at runtime. For example instantiating caesar ciphers with multiple different steps, passing them around, and then switching between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "%- Principle: Encapsulation / Information hiding (coupling, hide what changes)\n",
    "%    - <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13913174/what-are-the-differences-between-information-hiding-and-encapsulation>\n",
    "%- Principle: The state space of a type should equal the state space of whatever domain concept it is modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructors solve two main problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They allow us to initialize the [fields](fields) (and [properties](properties) but we haven't talked about those yet) of an object upon creation.\n",
    "2. They allow us to validate whether it, in the current state of the world and given the data that we have been passed, is possible to create an instance of the object or not. This problem can generally be thought of as \"validation\" or \"sanitization\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The second point is very important since it allows us to assume that any instance of a type actually is a valid instance of that type.\n",
    "Remember the maxim of making impossible states impossible in the chapter on [types over tests](types-over-tests)?\n",
    "We can use constructors to make sure that our application never contains an instance (meaning value) that's nonsensical given the definition of that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the notion of vowels for example.\n",
    "According to the [bijection rule](types-over-tests) or the notion of types over tests, it is not sensible to use a `char` to model vowels.\n",
    "The two data types support different values and different operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A constructor, in C#, is any method whose name is the same as the enclosing type (in this case: class) and that doesn't specify a return type.\n",
    "There is no need to specify a return type because a constructor always returns instances of the type in which it is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class [identifier]\n",
    "{\n",
    "  public [identifier] (<[parameters]>)\n",
    "  {\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter on [classes](classes) we discussed the keyword `new` which is used to create instances of a class.\n",
    "When we use the keyword `new` followed by a class name, a pair of parentheses, and possibly some arguments, then a constructor (that matches that list of arguments is called) is called and we get back an object of that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say \"a constructor\" rather than \"the constructor\" since constructors support overloading and so a class might have any number of constructors.\n",
    "More on that in a moment though.\n",
    "\n",
    "%Let's write a constructor for the `Balloon` class that we discussed in the chapter on [classes](classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "Remember the `static` method `MakeCircle` from the chapter on [access modifiers](access-modifiers)?\n",
    "The idea of that method is, metaphorically, not far away from the idea of a constructor.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't define a constructor for a class in C# then it's as if that class contains a constructor that takes no parameters and has no method body.\n",
    "As soon as we define a constructor though, this empty and parameterless constructor is no longer implicitly created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we, in the chapter on [fields](fields), mentioned that instance fields in C# are automatically intialized to their default values unless we initialize them ourselves in the class or upon construction using an [object initializer](object-initializers)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get back to our good old trusted `Rectangle` example."

    "\n",
    "Constructor chaining essentially means calling another constructor from a constructor before we run the body of our constructor.\n",
    "We do this by using the `this` keyword, *not* in the body of the constructor, but directly after the method signature.\n",
    "The `this` keyword in that context acts like a call to a constructor.\n",
    "We say \"a\" and not \"the\" since what constructor is called depends on what argument list we provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we're implementing the single parameter constructor in terms of the multi parameter constructor.\n",
    "In other words, instead of assigning width and height in our single parameter constructor, we simply take the value that was passed to us and sends it on to the other constructor which will do the assigning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This essentially the same idea as when we implemented one overload of the instance method `Scale` in the chapter on [instance methods](instance-methods) in terms of another overload.\n",
