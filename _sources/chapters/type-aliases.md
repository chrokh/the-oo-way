# Type aliases

%```{note}
%At this point you might be wondering why all data types we've seen up to this point starts with a capital letter except for `int`.
%This is because `int` is an alias for the type `Int32`.
%Aliases are defined for more basic types sych as `string`, `bool`, `double`, and so forth.
%More on aliases in the chapters on [data types](data-types) and [namespaces](namespaces).
%
%You can find a table of more aliases [in the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types).
%The aliases are, [according to the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/strings/), preferred since we don't have to explicitly include the namespace `System` to have access to them.
