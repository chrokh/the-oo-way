    "% TODO: Must mention that abstract classes still can have constructors!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstract classes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to use [inheritance](inheritance) for purposes of code reuse but we don't want it to be possible to instantiate the superclass.\n",
    "Sometimes it just doesn't make sense to have instances of the super class on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's as if we would like to use an [interface](interfaces) but find that if we do then we have to duplicate some code that we could otherwise reuse through inheritance.\n",
    "Granted, at this point, all your smoke sensors should be sounding.\n",
    "In a later chapter we will talk about the design principle [composition over inheritance](composition-over-inheritance).\n",
    "You probably should solve this problem with composition rather than inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we have not yet discussed composition over inheritance which often relies on [abstract injected object composition](abstract-injected-object-composition) which we also haven't talked about, let's instead talk about how we can solve this using abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class is similar to an [interface](interfaces) in the sense that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* it cannot be instantiated, and\n",
    "* it can declare signatures of members that its inheritors must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class is similar to a class in the sense that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* it can contain members with implementations that it's inheritors will inherit (and not just signatures).\n",
    "\n",
    "In an abstract class we can mark any combination of its (public) members as `abstract`.\n",
    "It is legal to mark all of them as well as none of them as `abstract`.\n",
    "If they are marked as `abstract` then that means that they cannot have any implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: Any of its non-private, non-sealed members??\n",
    "\n",
    "Any member marked as `abstract` must be [overridden](overriding) in all non-abstract classes that inherit from the abstract class.\n",
    "We emphasize the word *non-abstract* since abstract classes of course may inherit from abstract classes.\n",
    "Only when we reach a non-abstract class must we start implementing the abstract members.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C# we can declare that a class is abstract by simply prepending the word `abstract` before the keyword `class` but after any [access modifiers](access-modifiers).\n",
    "In C# we can declare that a method is abstract by prepending the word `abstract` before the return type but after any [access modifiers](access-modifiers).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### UML class diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "In UML class diagrams, the standard is to denote abstract members using italic text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the hierarchy of sequences that we built in the chapter on [inheritance](inheritance)?\n",
    "We never really discussed it, but it was quite awkward that the base class was called `Sequence` even though it was evidently modeling the sequence of incrementing integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since a non-abstract base class must have an implementation for all instance members we were left having to choose one sequence to act as the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we have to choose between calling the base class `Sequence` and `IntSequence`.\n",
    "The former is not an excellent representation for the implementation that we have while the latter is not an excellent name for a base class.\n",
    "We will discuss the rules of \"behavioral subtyping\" in the chapter on [Liskov substitution principle](liskov-substitution-principle).\n",
    "However, the consequence of thinking of the base class as the sequence of incrementing integers is that all subtypes of `Sequence` now must be specializations of that sequence that don't violate the rules of that sequence.\n",
    "What if, for example, we also want to model decrementing sequences?\n",
    "The condition is too restrictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the alternative?\n",
    "Well, remember how I in the chapter on [inheritance](inheritance) said that I personally have yet to come across a case of inheritance that isn't more elegantly solved using interfaces and composition?\n",
    "If you've seen that then you know where my sympathies lie.\n",
    "The base type should be an interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, since we should never dismiss something without first fully understanding how sit works and what we can do with it, let's force ourselves to keep using inheritance.\n",
    "Using an abstract base class is much better than using a concrete base class in the case of our sequnce hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By making the base class abstract we are guaranteed that there will be no instances of that class.\n",
    "This in turn means that we don't have to worry about specifying both the interface (in the abstract sense of the word) *and* the implementation for all memebrs of the superclass.\n",
    "This means that we can choose to specify only the interface where we want to leave the implementation very open, and conversely actually provide an implementation where that implementation makes sense in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how we might write that class in C#."
