# Static classes (Modules)

- Define in terms of sets. The set of values contain a single element which is the one you'll always get. The set of methods can contain any number of values.
- These should be thought of as modules, not as classes.
- Does not have anything to do with OO.
- Explain how top-level statements expand to `static void main` that was mentioned in Compilation chapter.
  - "Top-level statements must precede namespace and type declarations."
    - First statements, then classes.
