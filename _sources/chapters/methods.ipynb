    "# Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the design principle \"[don't repeat yourself](DRY)\"?\n",
    "The more code we repeat, the more likely we are to introduce bugs.\n",
    "Remember how we said that the way we avoid duplicating code is by increasing abstraction?\n",
    "Well, one such abstraction is that of the procedure, method, or function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the procedure, method, or function, is, in procedural programming, that we can take a sequence of statements, give that sequence a name, and then whenever we want to execute that sequence we just issue the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "I prefer using the word \"method\" rather than \"function\" in the context of object oriented programming since functions in imperative languages tend to be [impure](purity).\n",
    "We'll talk about what that means in a separate chapter but in short, a pure function is a function that, given the same input, always returns the same output.\n",
    "But, since functions/methods in C# can depend on and change state, they are not pure.\n",
    "But I digress, we'll talk more about this in the chapter on [purity](purity).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I bring this up is that while I would prefer using the term \"method\", we're now going to use a feature of C# called \"local functions\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at what C# calls local functions.\n",
    "Local functions are private methods nested inside another member like a method or a constructor for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Wait a minute!\n",
    "What are these strange words?\n",
    "Private, member, constructor.\n",
    "Why are we starting here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, perhaps you remember how we in the chapter on [compilation](top-level-statements) discussed how C# supports something called \"top-level statements\" which allow you to just start writing code without having to define a main class and a static main method.\n",
    "It's not that the main method doesn't exist, it's just that it's generated for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what should you take away from all this nonsense?\n",
    "When we're using top-level statements and start defining methods without making them members of a class then they will be either local functions or [lambda expressions](lambdas) which we'll talk about much later.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A local function consists of four parts that we must understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A name.\n",
    "2. A return type.\n",
    "3. A list of parameters with types.\n",
    "4. An implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} https://via.placeholder.com/700x200?text=Image+coming+soon\n",
    ":name: fig:local-method\n",
    "\n",
    "A local function consists of four parts: A name, a return type, a list of parameters, and an implementation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code example below we're defining a local function called `add` which takes two parameters of type `int` and returns a value of type `int`."
