    "# Access modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "% ALSO: MODIFIERS FOR CLASSES.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've talked about both [instance fields](fields) and [instance methods](instance-methods) we're finally ready to meaningfully talk about access modifiers.\n",
    "Remember how we said that `public` fields \"break encapsulation\" or \"violate the principle of information hiding\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "We said that we should hide data inside objects so that others cannot reach into our objects and change the data on our behalf.\n",
    "Data should be encapsulated inside objects.\n",
    "Data is, what we call, an \"implementation detail\" that should be `private`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We use access modifiers to modify the accessibility of static and instance [fields](fields), static and instance [properties](properties) as well as and [static](static-methods) and [instance methods](instance-methods).\n",
    "Accessibility is also sometimes referred to as \"visibility\" or \"protection level\".\n",
    "The accessibility level essentially determines whether or not we can access something from outside of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about access modifiers in relation to the class members fields and methods in this chapter.\n",
    "Using access modifiers with properties is something that we'll discuss directly in the chapter on access modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use access modifiers to modify the accessibility of classes, records, and structs but that's not something we'll discuss here.\n",
    "% TODO: Will we discuss class access modifiers at all in this book?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three basic access modifiers that we'll discuss in this book: `public`, `private`, and `protected`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `public` means accessible by whoever has access to the class.\n",
    "- `private` means accessible *only* from within the class itself.\n",
    "- `protected` means accessible *only* from within the class itself *and* any of its [subclasses](inheritance).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that we are talking about from what *classes* a member is accessible from.\n",
    "We're not talking about from what *objects* a member is accessible from.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for example we say that a field called `name` is `private` in a class called `Person` then that doesn't mean that any given person only ever can access its own name.\n",
    "It can access its own name but it can also access the name of any other person that we've passed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it this way: The class `Person` *knows about* the idea of `name` and hence can access the `name` field on any object that it has access to.\n",
    "Outside of the class `Person` however, we have no idea about the existence of the field `name` since that field has been marked as `private`.\n",
    "We'll talk more about this caveat in the examples section of this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have yet to discuss [inheritance](inheritance) we cannot discuss the modifier `protected` in detail, so we'll return to that in a [later chapter](advanced-access-modifiers).\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: Do I need to write more about accessibility and static members in this chapter??\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about methods first since its easier.\n",
    "To change the accessibility of an [instance method](instance-methods) we simply add an access modifier before the data type in our type signature.\n",
    "In the case of [static methods](static-methods) we simply add an access modifier before the `static` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<class-identifier>\n",
    "{\n",
    "  <access-modifier> [static] <return-type> ([<param1-type> <param1-name>, ...])\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    [method-body]\n",
    "  };\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice for example how the method `sizeString` is marked as `private` in the example below."
