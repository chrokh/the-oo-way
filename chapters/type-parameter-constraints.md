# Type parameter constraints

```{warning}
Coming soon.
```

% If we constraint SubstititionCipher to ICipher<T,String> and ICipher<T,char> then we might be able to get rid of the adapter from the chapter on abstract injected object composition?

% If we do need some type information about the type that we've parameterized over.
% This is like a universally quantified type where the parameter must belong to some other set.
