    "# Delegates\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: This first part should perhaps be moved to strategy pattern intro?\n",
    "Verbs are just as important as nouns.\n",
    "Functions are also values.\n",
    "Functions have types, just like values have types.\n",
    "The value `2` might have type `int` and the function `+` might have type `int -> int`.\n",
    "We would read the latter as \"int to int\".\n",
    "Or verbosely, we would say that the function `+` maps from `int` to `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegates, in C#, can be viewed as a more compact implementation of strategy pattern.\n",
    "Inversely, strategy pattern can be seen as a way to implement delegates in object oriented languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A delegate, in C#, is a *type* whose values are methods.\n",
    "Since we are talking about imperative programming, where functions are usually not [pure](purity), I will, as [previously discussed](methods), use the word \"method\" rather than \"function\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If the values of a type are methods, then the type must define what these methods take as input and what they produce as output.\n",
    "In other words, a delegate defines the method signature (including return type) that all members of the delegate type, meaning methods that belong to the type, share.\n",
    "More verbosely, a delegate defines the return type and the parameter list of all values of that delegate type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a delegate is a type and not a value, it has to gate can be defined directly in a [namespace](namespace), or as a member of a [class](classes).\n",
    "We cannot define a delegate inside a method, just like how we cannot define a new class inside another method.\n",
    "We can however define a new class inside a namespace or another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a delegate we use the keyword `delegate` then state the return type of the delegate type, followed by the name of the delegate type, which is finally followed by a parameter list."
