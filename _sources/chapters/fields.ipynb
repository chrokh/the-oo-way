    "# Fields\n",
    "%- Public / private / protected.\n",
    "%- Static / instance.\n",
    "%- Also works on struct.\n",
    "%- Only use private / protected fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "%- [Initialized to default value](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We've said that objects mix data and methods.\n",
    "We've referred to this idea as [encapsulation](encapsulation).\n",
    "That objects \"encapsulate\" data.\n",
    "In this chapter we're going to talk about what it means for objects to encapsulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many languages, we call a variable that is encapsulated in an object an \"instance variable\".\n",
    "In C# we use the term \"instance field\".\n",
    "The concept of \"fields\" is used both for \"instance fields\" and \"static fields\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a book on object oriented programming, and not procedural programming, we will almost exclusively discuss instance fields.\n",
    "In the chapter on [static methods](static-methods) we learned that static methods are methods that are namespaced to a class.\n",
    "We also learned that this is an idea from procedural programming and that it has nothing to do with object oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key idea in object oriented programming is that of [subtype polymorphism](subtype-polymorphism).\n",
    "In an object oriented langauge, both instance methods and instance variables are usually implemented so that they support subtype polymorphism.\n",
    "But this is something we'll get to later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"instance variable\", I think, is really quite revealing.\n",
    "Instance variables are variables that are connected to an instance.\n",
    "In other words, they are variables whose values might vary on an object-to-object basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two balloons, and we write the letter `'A'` on one of them, and the letter `'B'` on the other then these balloons have different states.\n",
    "The two balloons are both still balloons, but their states are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "We declare an instance field just like we define a regular [local variable](variables).\n",
    "By specifying the type of the variable, and then the identifier name that we want to use for the variable.\n",
    "However, we declare instance or static variables (meaning fields) \"inside\" the definition of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add the keyword `static` before the type in the declaration, then we are making a static field.\n",
    "If we don't add the keyword `static` then we are making an instance field.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<class-identifier>\n",
    "{\n",
    "  <access-modifier> [static] <field-type> <field-identifier>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we've got a class called `Balloon`, with two instance fields.\n",
    "One is called `Text` and the other is called `Diameter`."
