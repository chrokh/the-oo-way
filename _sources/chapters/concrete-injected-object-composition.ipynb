    "# Concrete injected object composition\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Prerequisites\n",
    ":class: info\n",
    "In this chapter weâ€™re exploring the object composition abstraction level that we refer to as \"concrete injected object composition\". Please have a look at the chapter [object composition](object-composition:abstraction-levels) if you have not already.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "When we move from *constructed* to *injected* object composition we gain run-time modifiability of which object is being composed.\n",
    "We gain the ability to change which object is composed into the composing object at run-time, instead of just at compile-time.\n",
    "This is a form of \"[dependency injection](dependency-inversion-principle)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean?\n",
    "Think back to the ciphers that we built in the chapter on [concrete constructed object composition](concrete-constructed-object-composition).\n",
    "Remember how `FlipFlopCaesarCipher` had to expose all constructor parameters of `CaesarCipher`, the object that it constructed.\n",
    "More generally, any constructor parameter of the composed object that we want to remain variable has to be exposed as a parameter (possibly through the constructor) of the composing object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "The danger of concrete constructed object composition is that whenever the constructor of the composed object changes, the composer must also change.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "%Whenever we want to change the constructor of the composed object, that change ripples and causes the composing object to also have to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this a problem?\n",
    "Well, the change \"ripples\" through the system.\n",
    "This is really bad for [maintainability](maintainability) and is part of an [anti-pattern](anti-pattern) called \"[shotgun surgery](shotgun-surgery)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "When thinking about whether something is a good or bad design decision we should ask ourselves what happens if we take our current practice to the extreme.\n",
    "What happens if I design my whole system like this?\n",
    "What happens if I compose ten objects like this?\n",
    "We'll talk more about design in the chapter on [maintainability](maintainability) and its related chapters.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if I have a class that instantiates a class, that instantiates a class, that instantiates a class, that instantiates a class, and so forth...\n",
    "Well, if all the constructors have parameters and we want to expose all parameters then we will have to expose all parameters of all the constructors in the constructor of the outermost class.\n",
    "This is bizarre and a nightmare to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "If you use constructed object compostion all the way \"down\", the you have to sum the number of constructor arguments all the way \"up\". Remember the [DRY](DRY) principle? Kind of sounds like a lot of duplication, don't you think?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, hopefully that settles it.\n",
    "Concrete constructed object composition should be used sparingly and with caution.\n",
    "Let's talk about better forms of object composition: injected object composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we do *injected* concrete object composition instead of *constructed*?\n",
    "Simple, by passing the composed object *itself* instead of the parameters of the object.\n",
    "Instead of asking for parameters that I need to construct an object, I simply ask for the complete object.\n",
    "Instead of directly creating the object that we need, we simply state what the data type is of the thing that we need.\n",
    "Whoever is calling us is now responsible for getting hold of such an object before calling us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Injection gives us the ability to expose the constructor parameters of the composed object without having to duplicate the parameters in the composing object.\n",
    "Injection move the construction of the composition out of the composing object.\n",
    "A third party is now resposible for instantiating the composer, the composed, and providing the composed to the composer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We simply say: in order for me to do my job I need something of type `XYZ`, so if you need me to do my job you must first pass me something of type `XYZ`.\n",
    "Whether our caller is the one who creates the object in the end is none of our concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "In dependency injection, we expect an object that our callers are responsible for constructing instead of parameters that we use to construct the object ourselves.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "%Remember the term [indirection](indirection)?\n",
    "%Instead of doing the thing directly, we let some other thing do the thing and then use that thing.\n",
    "%In this case, we are talking about \"dependency injection\".\n",

    "Let's keep working on the `FlipFlopCaesarCipher` that we introduced in the chapter on [concrete constructed object composition](concrete-constructed-object-composition).\n",
    "It composes our `CaesarCipher` so first we need to get a hold of that definition."
