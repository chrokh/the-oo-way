    "% TODO: Must use terminology static/compile-time type safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we briefly saw in the chapter on [Errors](errors), type checking is an activity performed by the compiler.\n",
    "In the process of type checking the compiler ensures that the program is sound on the type level.\n",
    "Concretely this means that the compiler checks what type that every [expression](expressions) will evaluate to and whether that type is acceptible at the place where it will be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type-checking can be performed at compile-time or at run-time.\n",
    "In C# type-checking occurrs at compile-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplistically put, type-checking concerns ensuring that all expressions evaluate to values of types that are compatible with whatever type is expected where the expressions are evaluated.\n",
    "This not only includes checking for example arithmetic and logical expressions but also method calls.\n",
    "We have yet to talk about [methods](static-methods), but as we saw in the chapter on [data types](operations) methods too have types.\n",
    "The type of a method declaration is its name; its number, order, and type of arguments; as well as its return type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Type-checking exists to enforce a property known as [type safety](type-safety).\n",
    "Type safety refers to not allowing the execution of operations that violate the [type system](type-system).\n",
    "Allowing such operations could lead to undefined behavior since their implementation is unspecified.\n",
    "C# is believed to be a type-safe language.\n",
    "%The definitions of \"type safety\" varies but under one definition, a type-safe language guarantees that no valid programs lead to undefined behavior.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type errors\n",
    "\n",
    "When type-checking discovers an error we call this a \"type error\".\n",
    "A type error means that we've expressed something where the *types* don't \"line up\".\n",
    "If we try, for example, to use a value of a type that is not `bool`, and that cannot be implicitly converted to `bool`, where a `bool` is expected then we get a type error.\n",
    "More on implicit conversions in the chapter on [type conversions](type-conversions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we were attempting to assign, say a value of type integer, to a variable of type boolean.\n",
    "Have a look at the error we get."
