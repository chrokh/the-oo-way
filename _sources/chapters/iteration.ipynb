    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "(DRY)=\n",
    "A key idea in programming is the maxim: \"don't repeat yourself\".\n",
    "The idea is that code should not be duplicated.\n",
    "We should never write the same thing twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "Don't repeat yourself. (DRY)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we write the same code multiple times, then there's a higher risk that we'll introduce bugs.\n",
    "Even if we manage to not introduce bugs the first time we're duplicating code we'll have to exercise the same level of extreme caution as seoon as we want to change the duplicated code.\n",
    "If we duplicate an idea in multiple places, then we have to change that idea in all places everytime we want to change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it.\n",
    "Let's say that you and I have a meeting at 8.00 tomorrow and I make a note of this appointment in both my calendar and my reminder app.\n",
    "If you then call me and say that you have to reschedule to 10.00 then I better remember to change both of my notes or hope that whenever I want to remind myself of which time we're going to meet I happen to check whatever note has the correct time.\n",
    "Not ideal.\n",
    "Try to think in terms of single sources of truth.\n",
    "Things should only be said once.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes we do want to do things multiple times.\n",
    "The solution to duplication can be summed up in one word: abstraction.\n",
    "One such abstraction is that of iteration.\n",
    "The realization is that it is to define, what is called, a \"block\" of statements and then state that this block must be executed as long as some condition remains true.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{seealso}\n",
    "We'll talk a lot more about questions like this in the chapter on [maintainability](maintainability) and those that follow it.\n",
    "So don't worry, there's a lot more to discuss here.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In imperative languages we often find at least four basic iteration statements.\n",
    "In C# we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `for` statement which executes a block for as long as some condition remains true, given some initializer, and some iterator.\n",
    "- The `foreach` statement executes a block for each element in a collection such as an [array](arrays).\n",
    "- The `do` statement executes a block *one* or more times as long as some condition remains true.\n",
    "- The `while` statement executes a block *zero* or more times as long as some condition remains true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "%### The `for` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "%### The `foreach` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "%### The `do` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "%### The `while` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(iteration-reverse)=\n",
    "### Reverse cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use another cipher as an example.\n",
    "In the chapter on algorithms we discussed the simple idea of a [reverse cipher](reverse-cipher).\n",
    "Not the most effective cipher in terms of \"hiding\" the contents of a message, but a cipher nonetheless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the pseudo code in the [algorithms](reverse-cipher) chapter we conclude that one way to implement this cipher is to iterate over the `string`, one character at a time, backwards and append each character to the `string` one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "(string-indexers)=\n",
    "To access individual elements of a string we must make a quick detour into something called [indexers](indexers).\n",
    "That is a concept which we'll talk about in a much later chapter.\n",
    "However, the short story is that, since the type `string` has an indexer defined, it is possible to access the individual `char` elements that make up a `string` using bracket notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's for example say that we have a `string` called `msg` that contains the the value `\"hello\"`."
