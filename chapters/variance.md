# Variance

```{warning}
Work in progress.
```

% - Invariance (neither)
% - Covariance
% - Contravariance
% - Variant = co, contra, or bi
% - Bivariant = co and contra

%Constructor is an exception from in=covariant/out=contravariant rule. Not really an exception. The rule doesn't apply. Because constructors are not polymorphic and dynamically dispatched. Constructors are like static methods. Whenever we run them we know exactly what type we have.
