# Paradigms

```{warning}
Work in progress.
```

%- Imperative
%  - Procedural
%  - Object oriented
%- Declarative
%  - Functional
%  - Logic
%- C# is multi-paradigm.
%- Should generic programming be listed as its own paradigm?
%- There are more paradigms and what falls where might depend on who you ask.

%What is the difference between the object oriented and the procedural paradigm?

%```{exercise}
%Why is the object oriented paradigm still considered imperative?

%What is a multi-paradigm language?

%```{exercise}
%What is meant with the saying "everything is an object"?

%```{exercise}
%In what way is C# not a purely object oriented language?



%We'll talk a bit more about the {doc}`imperative programming paradigm<paradigms>` later but for now we should realize that in the imperative paradigm, we execute our programs line by line and that future lines may *change* what was said in previous lines.
%But in mathematics (and in the functional paradigm), we state what is true without order of execution.
%This mathematical way of thinking where there is no order of execution is reflected in the declarative paradigm where you will find functional and logic programming.
%Don't worry if this isn't entirely clear, we'll get back to it in the chapter on {doc}`paradigms`.
