    "% TODO: ICipher<TIn,TOut> should perhaps be ICipher<TOut,TIn> to be consistent with Func interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "%TODO: __ Example of variance could be the class using Predicate interface from an exercise in the chapter on [abstract inject object composition](abstract-injected-object-composition:exercises:predicates). Works only for CharToChar but with generics could work on both.__\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter on [generics](generics) we gave an introduction to the different aspects of generics.\n",
    "In this chapter we will discuss \"generic types\", meaning generic classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter on [generics](generics) we showed how some problems cannot sensibly be solved by means of [subtype polymorphism](subtype-polymorphism) (overriding) or [ad-hoc polymorphism](overloading) (overloading).\n",
    "In cases where the implementation is the same, but the types are different, and no type can be a subtype of the other, it is instead often possible to use parametric polymorphism (or \"generics\" as we call it in C#) to eliminate duplication and increase modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use case for generic types in C# is probably that of generic collections.\n",
    "C# offers an extensive [type hierarchy](type-hierarchies) of generic collection types which include both interfaces and concrete classes.\n",
    "This involves everything from simple types like `Set<T>` and `Stack<T>` to more complex types like `Dictionary<TKey,TValue>` and `KeyedCollection<TKey,TItem>`.\n",
    "%Part of this hierarchy is depicted in {numref}`fig:generic-collections-hierarchy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are tons of problems that we can solve by writing our own generic types and that's mostly what we're going to explore in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "Generic types allow us to build arbitrarily complex types that depend on other types without needing any knowledge of said types, and while still retaining static type safety.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to build a type that somehow depends on some other type or types without using generics you have to either resort to using the [dynamic](type-systems) keyword or treat your dependencies as the top-type [object](type-hierarchies).\n",
    "In both cases we will most likely have to perform unsafe [type conversions](object-type-conversions) to do anything meaningful.\n",
    "Which means that we run the risk of run-time errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example without using generics.\n",
    "Let's say that we're trying to build a simple and [immutable](immutable-objects) type that simply encapsulates a value of an unknown type.\n",
    "The value is set through the constructor and can be extracted through a [property](properties).\n",
    "Let's call it a \"box\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `dynamic` keyword it would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "class DynamicBox\n",
    "{\n",
    "  public dynamic X { get; private set; }\n",
    "  public DynamicBox (dynamic x) => X = x;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the top-type object it would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "class ObjectBox\n",
    "{\n",
    "  public object X { get; private set; }\n",
    "  public ObjectBox (object x) => X = x;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple enough, right?\n",
    "Does it work?\n",
    "Sure, both these types work in the sense that we can instantiate them and plop any type of value inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Aside\n",
    "In fact, if our type could store multiple values at the same time (like say a list) we could even mix values of different types in the same box.\n",
    "If you want to read more about such a type, have a look at the archeic type `ArrayList` in the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.arraylist?view=net-6.0#remarks).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try putting values of different types in our boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "new DynamicBox(123);\n",
    "new DynamicBox(\"hello\");\n",
    "\n",
    "new ObjectBox(123);\n",
    "new ObjectBox(\"hello\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "No compile-time errors.\n",
    "No run-time errors.\n",
    "So far so good.\n",
    "But when we try to access the values that are contained in a box we might get slapped with run-time errors since the box could contain values of a type that's different from what we were expecting.\n",
    "In the example below, we store a `string` in the box built using `dynamic` and then extract the value and try to assign it to a variable of type `int`.\n",
    "The code compiles.\n",
    "But what happens when we run it?\n",
    "Boom!\n",
    "We get hit with a run-time exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "DynamicBox dynStrBox = new DynamicBox(\"hello\");\n",
    "int number = dynStrBox.X;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```output\n",
    "Unhandled exception. Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException: Cannot implicitly convert type 'string' to 'int'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this error just says that we can't *implicitly* convert between the types.\n",
    "What if we *explicitly* convert (by saying `(int)dynStrBox.X`)?\n",
    "Same problem, we just get a different exception.\n",
    "A `string` is just simply not an `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```output\n",
    "Unhandled exception. Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException: Cannot convert type 'string' to 'int'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try doing the same thing with the box built using `object`.\n",
    "Note that now we're using the type `object` as opposed to bypassing static type-checking all-together, as in the case of using the keyword `dynamic`.\n",
    "This means that we have to use [downcasting](object-type-conversions) to convert from `object` to whatever type we expect to have.\n",
    "Same thing here.\n",
    "The code compiles.\n",
    "But what happens when we run it?\n",
    "Boom!\n",
    "We get hit with a run-time exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "ObjectBox objStrBox  = new ObjectBox(\"hello\");\n",
    "int number = (int)objStrBox.X;\n",

    "\n",
    "```output\n",
    "Unhandled exception. System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Int32'.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, this is question of [dynamic vs static typing](static-vs-dynamic).\n",
    "If you use downcasting or the dynamic keyword you might as well leave the world of static typing all-together.\n",
    "As we've discussed in the chapters on [type checking](type-checking) and [type systems](type-systems) static typing has immense benefits.\n",
    "\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can still stick any type of value in the box.\n",
    "Importantly however, we must declare what type of values we will be putting in the box before we put any values there.\n",
    "More precisely, we must make a constructed generic type (e.g. `Box<int>`) out of our generic type definition (`Box<T>`) by replacing our type parameter (`<T>`) with a type argument (e.g. `<int>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Box<int> box5 = new Box<int>(123);\n",
    "Box<string> box6 = new Box<string>(\"hello\");\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now try to convert the value to a type of which it cannot be converted we get a type-error at compile-time.\n",
    "As we've discussed in [previous chapters](prefer-compile-time-errors) compile-time errors are much preferable than run-time errors.\n",

    "## Definition\n",

    "\n",
    "Both classes and interfaces can be used to declare generic type definitions.\n",
    "However, only interfaces support, what is known as, type parameter \"[variance](variance)\".\n",
    "Don't worry if you have no idea what that means.\n",
    "We will look at variance in detail in the chapter on [variant generic interfaces](variant-generic-interfaces).\n",
    "This means that all type parameters in generic class definitions are invariant as opposed to variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "A type parameter can be used anywhere in a generic type definition where a regular type would be used.\n",
    "This includes input and output types of methods; the type of variables, fields, or properties; or types delegates.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Unless you place [constraints](type-parameter-constraints) on a type parameter you cannot make any assumptions about what its interface is.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we can also use a type parameter when stating what other types our type [inherits from](inheritance) or which [interfaces](interfaces) it implements.\n",
    "That means that it's possible to combine [subtyping](subtype-polymorphism) and [generics](generics).\n",
    "As you might already suspect, that is very useful.\n",
    "In the examples section you'll find many cases of combining the two.\n",
    "Let's move on to the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll first build a simple generic type.\n",
    "Then we will spend some time refactoring our ciphers to use generics and combine it with subtyping.\n",
    "Finally, we will explore a few common generic collection types that are built in to .NET.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by building our own generic type for storing [immutable](immutable-objects) pairs of values.\n",
    "The two values in any given pair doesn't necessarily have to be of the same type.\n",
    "This data type is commonly called a \"Tuple\" and it should be noted that .NET already does has a type like this.\n",
    "Please see the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples) for more information.\n",
    "Nevertheless, this is a simple enough type to make a useful example.\n",
    "So let's go.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "class Pair<T1, T2>\n",
    "{\n",
    "  public T1 Value1 { get; private set; }\n",
    "  public T2 Value2 { get; private set; }\n",
    "\n",
    "  public Pair (T1 value1, T2 value2)\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    Value1 = value1;\n",
    "    Value2 = value2;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above defines a generic class, called `Pair`, with two type parameters referred to as `T1` and `T2`.\n",
    "Since there's only a single constructor which takes two arguments (one for each value in the pair) there's no way to construct an instance of `Pair` without also providing both values.\n",
    "The type also contains two [properties](properties) with [public](basic-access-modifiers) getters but private setters.\n",
    "So when you instantiate a pair you have to provide both values.\n",
    "When you have an instance you can extract the values but you cannot change them.\n",
    "That's it, and voilà, we've written our own generic type definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you use this?\n",
    "Well, remember, this is only a generic type definition.\n",
    "You have to turn it into a constructed generic type.\n",
    "How do you do that?\n",
    "By simply replacing the type parameters with actual types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Pair<int, int> p1;\n",
    "Pair<string, bool> p2;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code we're declaring the two variables `p1` and `p2` and we're saying that their types are two constructed generic types.\n",
    "The first constructed type replaces both type parameters with `int`.\n",
    "The second constructed type replaces `T1` with `string` and `T2` with `bool`.\n",
    "Let's now initialize some variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Pair<int, int> p3 = new Pair<int, int>(100, 200);\n",
    "Pair<string, bool> p4 = new Pair<string, bool>(\"Hello\", true);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above we create two new pair variables with the same type as before but now we initialize them immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "The type arguments in the compile-time type (meaning the type on the left) are the same types as the type arguments in the run-time types (meaning the type on the right).\n",
    "If the type parameters of the generic type are invariant then they have to be the same for type-checking to succeed.\n",
    "If you want to be able to use a different type argument in the run-time type, you must make your type parameters variant.\n",
    "But this we'll look into in the chapter on [variant generic interfaces](variant-generic-interfaces).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we said that generics retain static type safety?\n",
    "Since the constructed type of `p3` is `Pair<string, bool>` the compiler knows that anytime we use the getter for `Value1` we will get back a `string`, and whenever we access the getter for `Value2` we will get back a `bool`.\n",
    "That means that if we use the types in an incorrect manner we'll get a compiler error instead of an embarrassing and possibly costly run-time error.\n",
    "That's great.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "bool b = p3.Value1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```output\n",
    "error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type 'string' to 'bool'.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(generic-types:icipher)=\n",
    "### Generic cipher interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we, in the introductory chapter to [generics](generics), promised that we would combine our [interfaces](interfaces) `IStringToStringCipher`, `ICharToCharCipher`, and `ICharToStringCipher` into a single generic interface?\n",
    "That's what well do now.\n",
    "In the coming examples we'll see what this type allows us to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the cipher interfaces into a single interface is a simple task as soon as we realize that we can model encoding as the act of taking a value of some type as input and providing a possibly different value of possibly different type as output.\n",
    "Let's use meaningful names for our type parameters and call the two types `TIn` and `TOut`.\n",
    "The former (`TIn`) is the type of values that an implementor of our interface can encode.\n",
    "The latter (`TOut`) is the type of values that an implementor of our interface returns when encoding."
