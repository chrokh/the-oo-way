%- 3 pillars of OO
%  - Encapsulation
%  - Inheritance
%  - Polymorphism
%  - (Abstraction)
%- Refer to how {cite:t}`martin2017` claims that safe polymorphism is the only reasonable definition of OO.
%- Brief history of OO? Don't prioritize this.

%```{seealso}
%I highly recommend that you read Chapter 5 in [Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design][aff:clean-architecture] [affiliate link] by Robert C. Martin where you will learn how encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism were all available before object orientation.
