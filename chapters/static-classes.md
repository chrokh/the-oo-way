%- Include variables or make variables its own chapter?
%- These should be thought of as modules, not as classes.
%- Does not have anything to do with OO.
%- Explain how top-level statements expand to `static void main` that was mentioned in Compilation chapter.
%  - "Top-level statements must precede namespace and type declarations."
%    - First statements, then classes.
