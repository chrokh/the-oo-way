%- LSP.
%- Similar to how Comment chapter argues that you cannot describe all semantic details with names only.

%  - The figure drawn in the link above applies to methods in the sense that return types must be less specific in subtypes while input types must be more specific in subtypes.
%   - Start here: This is because functions are contravariant (wider) in input and covariant (narrower) in output. This is not a great explanation either since we can't actually swap out the input type for something more generic. It just expresses the constraints on the permissible behavior of the subtype.
%   - Properties are essentially pairs of methods which means that they must be invariant.
%  - In nominal subtyping it's probably most sensible to think of it in terms of 
% - Give examples of how LSP covariance, contravariance, and invariance rules can be violated by means of exceptions. This was mentioned in the chapter on subtype polymorphism.
