    "### The `if` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "An `if` statement has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (condition)\n",
    "{\n",
    "  consquent\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The curly brackets define the \"block\" of statments that is to be executed if the condition happens to be true.\n",
    "If your consequent only consists of a single line then you can omit the curly brackets that delimit the block and instead use [indentation](indentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (condition)\n",
    "  consequent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition must be an [expression](expressions) that evaluates to a [boolean](simple-types).\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if the condition isn't true?\n",
    "Well, then the statements in the block aren't executed.\n",
    "Can we define a different block to execute if the condition happens to be false?\n",
    "Yes, we certainly can.\n",
    "In most imperative languages this is defined by using the keyword `else`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (condition)\n",
    "{\n",
    "  consequent\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",
    "  alternative\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we can omit the curly brackets if we only want to execute single statements.\n",

    "```\n",
    "if (condition)\n",
    "  consequent\n",
    "else\n",
    "  alternative\n",

    "But what if we have more things to check?\n",
    "Can you nest conditions?\n",
    "Sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But, since this is such a common thing to do, there's also the `else if` keyword.\n",
    "The example above is equivalent to the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (condition1)\n",
    "  consequent1\n",

    "  consequent3\n",
    "else\n",
    "  consequent4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the usage of `if else` allows us to avoid ever increasing levels of indentation.\n",
    "As you might have suspected we can stack any number of `else if` statements after each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{caution}\n",
    "If statements are executed from the top down.\n",

    "Remember the Leet language that we talked about in the chapter on [algorithms](leet-language)?\n",
    "Much like the Robber's language the Leet language encodes the string by replacing character by character.\n",
    "In other words, it too is a substitution cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on what substitutions you choose in the Leet language your encoding might not be reversible, so let's pick a conservative subset of rules that makes it possible for us to reverse our encoded strings.\n",

    "Write an implementation that can translate any given `char` into a new `char` using the above scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the characters that aren't present in the scheme should just be passed through.\n",
    "So if we give the program the character `A` it should print `4`.\n",
    "If we give the program the character '4' then it should print 'A'.\n",
    "If we give the program the character `3` it should print `E`.\n",
    "And so forth.\n",
