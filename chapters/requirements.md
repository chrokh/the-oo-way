## Motivation
In this book we are concerned with **providing value by means of programming** in an object oriented language.
We've jumped into the deep end of programming without ever really stopping to think about why we would ever write code in the first place.

In this book we are *not* asking what a *beautiful* program looks like and we are not asking what a space- or time-efficient program looks like.

```{important}
In this book we are exploring how to write programs that not only make money today but also can keep making money in the future.
```

% TODO: Use below?
%In many domains, this is not the same challenge.
%So if you are interested in becoming a well-rounded, what we might call, architect, designer, or modeller of object oriented solutions, then you are in the right place.

I say "make money" because it points our attention to the challenge of balancing costs and benefits.
It points us to the challenge of always thinking in terms of return on investment (ROI).
Clearly, we write software for other reasons too.
Sometimes we write open source software and sometimes we work for non-profit agencies.
But no matter who you write the software for, if we are aiming to provide *value* (or *utility* if you prefer) for someone then we are always faced with the challenge of balancing input costs with output value.

This book does not see code as "l'art pour l'art", art for art's sake.
In this book we see code as a means to an end.

```{note}
Exploring how to solve problems using code and exploring a language out of pure curiosity is of course an excellent thing.
I myself have written countless pieces of code and read countless pages of documentation just for the sake of scratching my own itch.
In this book however, we focus on writing code to produce value.
```

So, all this leads us to the million dollar question.
What is valuable?
From the business owner's perspective, this is a non-trivial question.
But from our perspective as software developers, it's easier.

```{important}
Value is what our client deems valuable.
```

But what if we are entrepreneurs?
What if we're a tech startup?
Well then, all the power to you and I hope you take the world with storm.
If you are high up in the food chain of your company, then you my friend, are the client.

```{note}
In Scrum, a popular agile software development method, the representative from the client company who has the final say on what the software should and should not do and what should be prioritized is known as the "product owner".
We'll talk briefly about agile software development methods in the chapter on [maintainability](maintainability).
```

Ok, so how do we know what is valuable to the client?
Well, that's what we have the term "requirements" for.
