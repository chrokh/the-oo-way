# Exceptions (part 1)

- Unrecoverable states.
- Try / catch.
- Examples: NullReference, IndexOutOfRange, DivideByZero, StackOverflow, OutOfMemory, no internet connection, response timeout.
- Some languages such as Java require that you declare all exceptions that a method can throw.
- Erik Meijer: C# is less of an "honest language" since we don't declare exceptions and null in signatures.
