    "Remember how we said that there are at least [four types of polymorphism](subtype-polymorphism)?\n",
    "In object oriented programming subtype polymorphism is the really big one, but in hybrid languages such as C# parametric polymorphism is really important and frequently used.\n",
    "In C# parametric polymorphism is implemented through the concept known as \"generics\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For a basic understanding of generics / parametric polymorphism we must understand the topics below.\n",
    "The concepts are all discussed in separate chapters but in this chapter we provide an overview to the topic of generics as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Generic type parameters](generic-type-parameters).\n",
    "2. [Generic types](generic-types) (classes, interfaces, and structs).\n",
    "3. [Generic methods](generic-methods).\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing object oriented programs, you will often find that you are repeating yourself.\n",
    "Up to this point we've pretended that all duplication can be eliminated with subtype polymorphism and object composition.\n",
    "As you might have suspected, this is of course not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the case of the `CompositeCipher` that we wrote in the chapter on [abstract injected object composition](abstract-injected-object-composition).\n",
    "The class is dependency injected with two ciphers of type `ICharToCharCipher` and the class itself is an `ICharToCharCipher`.\n",
    "When we call the instance method `Encode` and supply some input the cipher runs the input through the first cipher, takes the result, and runs it through the second cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we said that it clearly should be possible to define a `CompositeCipher` type that instead supported ciphers of type `IStringToStringCipher`?\n",
    "But that doing so would involve duplicating the whole class.\n",
    "Have a look at the code below where we've duplicated the code in order to make a second class that supports `IStringToStringCipher`.\n",
    "The implementation of these two classes is virtually the same."

    "How should we go about removing this duplication?\n",

    "The two composite classes are fundamentally not in a subtyping relationship because `IStringToStringCipher` and `ICharToCharCipher` are fundamentally not subtypes.\n",

    "We've already learned that C# classes supports [covariant return types](variance) but not contravariant parameter types.\n",
    "Even if C# would support contravariant parameter types and even if variance would be supported in interfaces `IStringToStringCipher` and `ICharToCharCipher` are still not in a subtyping relationship.\n",
    "Even if `string` and `char` would be in a suptyping relationship (which they are not) where `char` would be a subtype (think: specialization) of `string` (which makes more sense than the other way around) `IStringToStringCipher` and `ICharToCharCipher` would still not be in a subtyping relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "Well, because if `ICharToCharCipher` is a subtype of `IStringToStringCipher` then the *input type* of the `Encode` method must be *covariant* since the subtype `ICharToCharCipher` returns a `char` which then is a specialization/subtype of `string`.\n",
    "But covariant input is not allowed according to the [Liskov Substitution Principle](liskov-substitution-principle).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so let's flip it?\n",
    "Well, if `IStringToStringCipher` is a subtype of `ICharToCharCipher` then the return type, the *output type* must be contravariant since the subtype `IStringToStringCipher` returns a `string` which is a generalization/supertype of `char`.\n",

    "In the following chapters we will replace our interfaces `ICharToCharCipher`, `IStringToStringCipher`, and `ICharToStringCipher` with a single generic interface, called `ICipher<TIn, TOut>`.\n",

    "As we shall see, parametric polymorphism not only help us eliminate duplicated code, but also spreads like a virus.\n",
    "The good kind of virus.\n",

    "Generic types increase the [maintainability](maintainability) of our code since they (at least) ought to increase modularity.\n",

    "Another important aspect is that of [static type safety](type-checking).\n",
    "Most things that we do with generics can trivially be achieved in dynamically typed languages, or even in C# by using the [`dynamic` keyword](type-systems) or by simply treating things as the top-type [object](inheritance).\n",
    "The fact that all types in C# inherit from object is something that we'll discuss in further detail in the chapter on [type hierarchies](type-hierarchies).\n",
    "The first strategy involve unsafe [type conversions](object-type-conversions) and the second potential [downcasting](object-type-conversions) which may cause [run-time errors](errors).\n",

    "So, what is a generic type?\n",
    "The term \"generic type\" refers to both the \"generic type definition\" and a \"*constructed* generic type\".\n",

    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we wrap this section up, let's finish up with some terminology directly from the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/generics/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Generic type parameters* (or simply type parameters) are placeholders for types in a generic type definition or generic method definition.\n",
    "- A *generic type definition* is a class, struct, or an interface declaration with type parameters. It is like a template rather than a complete type definition. An example is `List<T>`.\n",
    "- A *constructed generic type* is the result of replacing the type parameters in a generic type definition with actual types. An example is: `List<int>`.\n",
    "- A *generic type* is either a generic type definition or a constructed generic type.\n",
    "- A *generic method definition* is a method which before its formal parameter list (for values), also contains a list of generic type parameters. Type parameters can be used as the return type or as the type of formal arguments. An example is: `List<T> Repeat<T> (T value, int times)`. The `<T>` in the method name (`Repeat<T>`) is the type parameter.\n",
    "- A *generic type argument* is whatever type is used to replace a type parameter with an actual type. Just like how an argument is used in place of a parameter when applying methods, a generic type argument is used in place of a generic type parameter.\n",
    "- The *variance* of generic type parameters determine whether more or less derived type can be used when some constructed generic type is expected. Variance can only be specified for type parameters in generic interfaces.\n",
    "- *Constraints* on generic type parameters limit the types that can be used as type arguments. You might for example declare that a type parameter must be replaced with an argument that is not null, or that is a `class` (as opposed to a `struct` for example).\n",

    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use-case for generics is collections.\n",
    "Think about a list for example.\n",
    "When you're implementing a method that adds items to the list, do you really need to know what type of element you are adding?\n",
    "Not really, right?\n",
    "Adding is just a matter of sticking the element into the list.\n",
    "As long as the type of all elements in the list is the same, and as long as all instances of any list type have the same type, we're fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: Give example of a bunch of lists. Numbers, Strings, red colored dots, blue colored dots.\n",
    "```{figure} https://via.placeholder.com/700x200?text=Image+coming+soon\n",
    ":name: fig:generic-list\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as all elements in the list have the same type it doesn't matter what the type is.\n",
    "None of these lists have the same type, but these types can all be constructed from the generic list type.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a simpler example.\n",
    "How about the notion of a pair.\n",
    "This is sometimes also known as a \"tuple\".\n",
    "A pair is simply a collection of two elements.\n",
    "Let's refer to these elements as the `First` element and the `Second` element.\n",
    "The type of `First` might be the same as the type of `Second` or it might not.\n",
    "But if we define a data type for a pair then the type of `First` must be the same for every instance of the pair type.\n",
    "Same for `Second`.\n",
    "\n",
    "%```csharp\n",
    "%class Pair<T>\n",
    "%{\n",
    "%  public T First { get; set; }\n",
    "%  public T Second { get; set; }\n",
    "%}\n",
    "%```\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we define a generic type for pairs then we can create any number of non-generic types of pairs without having to write any implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: Group and color code pairs of similar types.\n",
    "```{figure} https://via.placeholder.com/700x200?text=Image+coming+soon\n",
    ":name: fig:generic-list\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as all instances of a pair type store elements of the same type in the first position and elements of the same type in the right position then it doesn't matter what these types are.\n",
    "The pairs that are grouped together have the same type, and all pair types could be constructed from the same generic pair type.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Can every type be converted into a generic type?\n",
    "No, some algorithms cannot be expressed without knowledge of the underlying type.\n",
    "Think about the difference between the act of adding another element to a list (which we've talked about) and that of arithmetic addition.\n",
    "Arithmetic addition is only defined for numeric types.\n",
    "If you want to say that there is an implementation for a type that is not a number then you have to define that implementation yourself.\n",
    "It's not obviously parametrically polymorphic.\n",
