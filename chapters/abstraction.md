(abstraction)=
# Abstraction

- Methods, classes, types.
- Implementation details.
- Solve problems by composing (combining) abstractions rather than having to be bothered with all the nitty gritty all the time.
- Analog examples:
  - Electrical wall outlet. You don't need to know anything about voltage or amps to use them.
  - Cars. You just fill them up and drive. Automatic transmission is a good example.
- Section 4.3 in {cite:et}`ousterhout2018`.
- Interfaces in the abstraction-sense of the word. In the input-output-how-to-interact-with sense of the word.
- Modeling
  - "Object thinking focuses our attention on the problem space rather than the solution space. Object thinkers take the advice of Plato, Parnas, Fred Brooks, Christopher Alexander, and many others by letting the problem define its own solution"

  - "Programming is not about typing, it's about thinking." [Rich Hickey](https://maximilianocontieri.com/software-engineering-great-quotes)
