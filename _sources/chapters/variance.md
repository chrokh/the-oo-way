# Variance

```{warning}
Work in progress.
```

% - Invariance (neither)
% - Covariance
% - Contravariance
% - Variant = co, contra, or bi
% - Bivariant = co and contra

% GREAT IDEA: USE KIDS BLOCKS AND HOLES ANALOGY TO EXPLAIN VARIANCE. THESE ARE SOURCES AND SINKS. OUTPUT AND INPUT.

%Constructor is an exception from in=covariant/out=contravariant rule. Not really an exception. The rule doesn't apply. Because constructors are not polymorphic and dynamically dispatched. Constructors are like static methods. Whenever we run them we know exactly what type we have. There is no subtyping.

%Example: Subtyping a covariant list and then adding an item shows why it must be invariant. It both gets and sets. Is this something that should not be discussed here but rather in the chapter on generics and variance?
