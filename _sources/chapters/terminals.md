# Terminals

```{warning}
This chapter is under construction.
```

- Existed before UIs.
- Fundamental in programming still.
- Mac (Terminal) and Windows (CMD).
- Basic commands:
  - `ls` / `dir`
  - `cd`
  - No need to learn anything more.
- Can even run text editors as you might have seen in my YouTube videos.
- How we document commands.
  - Optionality (`[Â ]`).
  - Replacements (`< >`).
  - Input/output with dollar sign and lack of dollar sign in multi-line code snippets. No dollar sign used in single-line snippets in this book. Use `echo` to exemplify.
