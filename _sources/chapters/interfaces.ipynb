    "# Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"interface\" is, in object oriented programming commonly used to mean two different but related things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A contract or an abstraction.\n",
    "2. A data type declared using the keyword `interface` present in many object oriented languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we'll make a distinction between these two by either saying \"interface\" or `interface`.\n",
    "Let's start with the abstract idea of an interface.\n",
    "What is an interface?\n",
    "\n",
    "%## The idea\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "An interface defines *what* something can do without defining *how* it does it.[^defaults]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: Interface default implementations:\n",
    "[^defaults]: Since C# 8.0, it is possible to define \"default implementations\" in interfaces which means that it now actually is possible to define the \"how\" in an interface. This chapter will soon be updated with more on this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we've learned that a [class](classes) consists of a bunch of instance and static members?\n",
    "Members are either methods or variables.\n",
    "Then we have [properties](properties) which can be thought of somewhere in between methods and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all [public](access-modifiers) [instance members](classes) of a class are part of what we call the \"interface\" of a class.\n",
    "An interface is a \"contract\" that tells us what we can do with something.\n",
    "In other words, the set of all public members define *what* we can do with objects of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a standard.\n",
    "If you've got a thing that adheres to some standard then you know how you can use that thing even if you don't know how the thing works \"inside\".\n",
    "A power plug can be plugged into an outlet if they share the same standard.\n",
    "We don't have to understand voltage, wattage, and amperage in order to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we've got an object and all we know is its interface then we know what methods we can call and what types to expect in return.\n",
    "We know what variables we can access and what types they have.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this a good idea?\n",
    "What's the point?\n",
    "Let's use an analogy.\n",
    "Think about screws, bolts, and screwdrivers.\n",
    "The drive type of the screw or bolt determines what screwdriver you need to screw or unscrew it.\n",
    "The same screwdriver can however be used to drive a wide number of different types of screws and bolts.\n",
    "Some fit into nuts, some are intended to penetrate material.\n",
    "Some are left-handed and some are right-handed.\n",
    "The same screwdriver can be used since different types of screws and bolts share the same drive type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drive type is what we would refer to as the \"interface\".\n",
    "Think of it as a \"standard\".\n",
    "It is the contract between the screw and the screwdriver.\n",
    "Screw manufacturers make sure that their screw heads adhere to a standardized drive type.\n",
    "Similarly, screwdriver manufacturers make sure that their screwdrivers adhere to a standardized drive type.\n",
    "\n",
    "%TODO: Replace image\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation between interface and implementation has immense benefits.\n",
    "For one we don't have to buy a new screwdriver every time we buy a new screw.\n",
    "In programming we refer to this as [reusability](reusability).\n",
    "\n",
    "But also, it means that we don't have to coordinate between screw manufacturers, bolt manufacturers, and screwdrive manufacturers.\n",
    "In programming we refer to this as [modifiability](modifiability).\n",
    "We'll talk more about both reusability and modifiability in the chapter on [maintainability](maintainability).\n",
    "\n",
    "%This is what we, in the chapter on maintainability, will refer to as \"[reusability](reusability)\".\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "An interface is often referred to as an \"abstraction\" while classes, in contrast, are referred to as \"concretions\".\n",
    "Classes are concrete in the sense that they can be instantiated into objects.\n",
    "Interfaces can however *not* be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "A class defines a compile-time and a run-time type.\n",
    "Interfaces *only define compile-time types* and cannot be instantiated.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, an interface is only a compile-time type.\n",
    "At run-time, any interface must be replaced by a run-time type.\n",
    "\n",
