    "\n",
    "%- TODO: Uniform access principle (use Robert Martin as source?)\n",
    "%\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to respect the principle of information hiding we sometimes we find ourselves writing instance methods to get and set private variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages, like C#, offer what in C# is called \"properties\" that help us keep doing this but with way less boilerplate code.\n",
    "%- Specific to some languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties in C# essentially allow us to use the getting and setting syntax of instance fields while allowing us to execute code before the setting and getting occurs just as when we manually wrote getter and setter instance methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties can be *read-write*, *read-only*, or *write-only*[^write-only-properties].\n",
    "The keywords `get`, `set`, and `init` are, in C#, known as \"property accessors\".\n",
    "If a property has a `get` accessor then we can ask for its value.\n",
    "If a property has a `set` or `init` accessor then we can set its value.\n",
    "In the case of `set` we can set it anytime but in the case of `init` we can only set it upon instantiation through an object initializer, the constructor or via another property marked as `init`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^write-only-properties]: The usefulness of write-only properties have been debated and the .NET style guidelines prescribes that [write-only properties always should be replaced by instance methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1044).\n",
    "\n",
    "Property accessors support [access modifiers](access-modifiers).\n",
    "It is therefore possible to, for example, have a field which is privately settable but publicly gettable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, properties can be marked as `required` which means that an object cannot be instantiated without having had the property initialized to a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "As with fields and methods, C# classes support both instance and static properties.\n",
    "Since this is a book on object oriented programming we're almost exclusively focusing on instance properties.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unpack what all this means.\n",
    "\n",
    "%- Synonyms: Getters / Setters, Accessors, Mutators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auto-implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter on [instance methods](instance-methods) we discussed how we can have `private` fields that we then expose `public` getters and setters for via instance methods.\n",
    "We refer to the `private` field as \"the backing field.\"\n",
    "It would look something like the code below."
