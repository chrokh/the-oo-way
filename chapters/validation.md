%What will you learn in this book?
%In this book we are first and foremost concerned with **providing value by means of programming** in an object oriented language.
%If you are familiar with the philosophies of Lean manufacturing, Lean startup, or Agile methods then you will know where my sympathies lie.
%
%In this book we are not asking what a beautiful program looks like and we are not asking what a technically efficient program (in terms of space time complexity) looks like.
%In this book we are exploring how to write programs that not only make money today but also can keep making money in the future.
%In many domains, this is not the same challenge.
%So if you are interested in becoming a well-rounded, what we might call, architect, designer, or modeller of object oriented solutions, then you are in the right place.

%```
%
%I say "make money" because it points our attention to the challenge of balancing costs and benefits.
%It points us to the challenge of always thinking in terms of return on investment (ROI).
%Clearly, we write software for other reasons too.
%Sometimes we write open source software and sometimes we work for non-profit agencies.
%But no matter who you write the software for, if we are aiming to provide value (or *utility* if you prefer) for someone then we are always faced with the challenge of balancing input costs with output value.
%
%In this book we are neither concerned with writing the fastest program nor are we concerned with writing the most elegant program.
%This book does not thinking of code as "l'art pour l'art", art for art's sake.
%In this book we see code as a means to an end.
%
%```{important}
%Code is a means to an end.
%```
%
%Exploring how to solve problems using code and exploring a language out of pure curiosity is of course an excellent thing.
%I myself have written countless pieces of code and read countless pages of documentation just for the sake of scratching my own itch.
%However, with this book I want to encourage you to deliberately practice to become a programmer that knows how to weigh the pros and cons of a solution in the face of real world business constraints and requirements.
