%- What you can call \& What you can declare (available / occupied).
%- The “using” keyword.
%- Example: Console.WriteLine lives inside of System. Only possible if importing System or explicitly referring to it.
%- Use terminology from docs. Show that you can access a named scope with dot-notation. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/basic-concepts)
%- Explicit vs implicit access. Resolving ambiguity by explicitly stating (even your own) namespace.
%- Note: Dot notation is also used for accessing members of a class but we’ll come back to this.
%- Type aliases `int`, `bool`, etc means that we don't have to explicitly import `System`. But in top-level statements we still don't have to import `System` since it's implicitly imported.
