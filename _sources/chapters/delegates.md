# Delegates

```{warning}
Work in progress.
```

%- Example: Use delegate version of `Predicate<T>` instead of `IPredicate<T>` that we saw in [generics](generics) and [abstract dependency injection](abstract-dependency-injection).
%- Implement the method that repeatedly applies ciphers using delegates instead. See the chapter on [subtype polymorphism](subtype-polymorphism).
