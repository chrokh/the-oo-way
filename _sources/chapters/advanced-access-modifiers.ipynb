    "# Advanced access modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing the [basic access modifiers](basic-access-modifiers) `public` and `private` we mentioned that many object oriented languages have another modifier known as `protected`.\n",
    "More specifically, if a language supports [inheritance](inheritance) it probably also supports the access modifier `protected`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why another modifier?\n",
    "Well, remember how `private` members only are accessible from wihtin the class they are defined in?\n",
    "The introduction of `protected` stems from the realization that in a language that supports [inheritance](inheritance) you might also want members that are private within a given inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap the definitions that we gave in the chapter on [basic access modififers](basic-access-modifiers)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `public` means accessible by whoever has access to the class.\n",
    "- `private` means accessible *only* from within the class itself.\n",
    "- `protected` means accessible *only* from within the class itself *and* any of its [subclasses](inheritance).\n",
    "\n",
    "A `protected` member is therefore like a `private` member except that it is `private` to the whole inheritance hierarchy below the type in which it is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### UML class diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "In UML class diagrams we use the symbol `#` to denote `protected`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how, in the chapter on [inheritance](inheritance:sequences), we defined a bunch of sequences.\n",
    "Remember how had two main \"styles\" of writing our algorithms?\n",
    "One one hand we could write our algorithms as formulas (such as in the case of the square series) and on the other as filters (such as in the case of the palindromic sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cases where we overrode the `Current` method we always had to introduce our own instance field that we were able to set the current value to.\n",
    "This happened because the `set` accessor of the property `Current` was marked as `private` in the superclass `Sequence`.\n",
    "In other words, subclasses did not have access to the setter even if they overrode the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why did we not just make the `set` accessor `public`?\n",
    "Because of [information hiding](information-hiding).\n",
    "We don't want others to be able to at will change the current value of a sequence.\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "Well what if we have an `EvenSequence` and someone changes the value to `3`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now change the access modifier of the `set` accessor to `protected`.\n",
    "This will allow us to implement some sequences as formulas without having to override the `Current` property.\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "Because all subclasses of `Sequence` will now have write-access to that property."
