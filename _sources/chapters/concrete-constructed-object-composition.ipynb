    "# Concrete constructed object composition\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Prerequisites\n",
    ":class: info\n",
    "In this chapter we're exploring the simplest level of object composition.\n",
    "Please have a look at the chapter [object composition](object-composition:abstraction-levels) if you have not already.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In procedural programming, as we've already seen, we solve problems by [composing procedures](method-composition).\n",
    "If a method calls another method then we've composed the two methods\n",
    "You might recall that we said that this form of composition is significantly less powerful than what in function programming is known as function composition.\n",
    "Concrete constructed object composition, which we're talking about right now, is essentially the equivalent to procedure composition.\n",
    "The only difference is that we [encapsulate](encapsulate) our procedures in objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In concrete constructed object composition, we make one object create another concrete object.\n",
    "The composing object does *not* receive an instance through its constructor or through any of its properties or instance methods.\n",
    "Instead, the composing object simply creates the composed object on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use our ciphers as an example and let's build something new.\n",
    "How about a cipher that flip flops between encoding and decoding between some variation of itself.\n",
    "Sounds weird but I think the results will be pretty fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the Caesar cipher for example.\n",
    "What does decoding mean in the context of a Caesar cipher?\n",
    "Well, if we encoded with `+1` then we must decode with `-1`.\n",
    "So decoding is the inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't really have to build anything fancy change our add new methods to our `CaesarCipher` class.\n",
    "That we will worry about later.\n",
    "For now we simply have to make sure to send the appropriate input to the constructor of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call this new invention of ours a flip flop Caesar cipher.\n",
    "Let's say we're encoding the string `AAAA`.\n",
    "With a regular Caesar Cipher where `steps = 1` we would get `BBBB`.\n",
    "But with a flip flop Caesar cipher starting from `1` we would get `BZBZ`.\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "Because the first `A` is encoded with `steps = 1`, the second with `steps = -1`, the third with `steps = 1`, and the fourth with `steps = -1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty cool right?\n",
    "Let's try to build this using concrete constructed object composition by composing the class `CaesarCipher` that we've already built in previous chapters."
