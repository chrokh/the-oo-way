    "# Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: Mention drawback of only one spot for inheritance. Referenced from chapter on Liskov.\n",
    "%- Base keyword!! Both in constructor context and beyond.\n",
    "%- Fragile base class. Example: Abstract class Shape which defines a Scale method that multiplies width and height with factor. This breaks if a subclass of Shape like Circle changes both Width and Height in response to a change in one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance, in object oriented languages, tend to serve two purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheriting the Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a subtype to either inherit or [override](overriding) instance members from its supertype. This can be thought of as inheriting the implementation and is sometimes called \"implementation inheritance\".\n",
    "2. Inheritance causes the subtype to be substitutable for the supertype in the sense of subtype polymorphism. This can be thought of as inheriting the type and is sometimes called \"interface inheritance\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already discussed the benefits of subtype polymorphism in the chapters on [interfaces](interfaces) and [subtype polymorphism](subtype-polymorphism).\n",
    "We have thus already dealt with the second point above, and will in this chapter therefore mostly focus on the first.\n",
    "Namely, that of using inheritance to eliminate duplication by allowing subclasses to use code from its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is of *vital importance* to realize that these two purposes always go hand-in-hand.\n",
    "Whenever we declare that a subclass inherits from a superclass, then we are always and without exception also declaring that the former is a subtype of the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, inheritance always leads to subtype polymorphism which means that we must take care not violate the [Liskov substitution principle](liskov-substitution-principle) or else we are in for a world of hurt.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{danger}\n",
    "Inheritance must *not* blindly be used for *code reuse* without respecting the rules of substitutability.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a binary directed relationship between two (possibly [abstract](abstract-classes)) classes or [interfaces](interface-inheritance).\n",
    "Similar to the terminology used in [subtype polymorphism](subtype-polymorphism) we refer to the two parties as sub/child/derived class/type and super/parent/base class/type.\n",
    "The subclass inherits both type and members from its superclass.\n",
    "We'll discuss [abstract classes](abstract-classes) in a separate chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare that a class is a subclass of another class in C# we use the same syntax as we use when declaring that the class implements some [interface](interfaces).\n",
    "In other words, we write a colon (`:`) after the class name and then the name of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we declare that the class `Child` inherits from the class `Parent`."

    "%\n",
    "%%Adapting the code above is trivial since we just have to state that the two classes implement the interface `ICipher`.\n",

    "%%class LeetStringCipher : ICipher { /* ... */ }\n",
    "%%```\n",

    "%Ok, but what does the common interface `ICharCipher` enable us to do?\n",
    "%Sure, we could redefine the lines that declare the variable `charCipher` in both `RobbersStringCipher` and `LeetStringCipher` so that the compile-time type is the abstraction `ICharCipher` rather than any concrete implementation of that interface.\n",

    "%\n",
    "%```csharp\n",
    "%class RobbersStringCipher\n",
    "%{\n",
    "%  RobbersCharCipher charCipher;\n",
    "%// ...\n",

    "%\n",
    "%\n",
    "%## Finding an abstraction\n",
    "%\n",
    "%However, what if we could get rid of the duplicated code in the `Encode` methods of the `string` ciphers.\n",
    "%That would be useful.\n",
    "%We have already learned the design principle abbreviated DRY, which stands for \"Don't Repeat Yourself\".\n",
    "%As we will learn later, duplicated code is also considered a [code smell](code-smell).\n",
    "%\n",
    "%Notice how *almost all the variation* between the ciphers in this chapter occurr in the `char` ciphers, not in the `string` ciphers.\n",
    "%Ignoring parameterization of constructors for now, we conclude that the *only* difference between `RobbersStringCipher` and `LeetStringCipher` is what *type* of `char` cipher they happen to instantiate and thus delegate to.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%So let's think about this.\n",
    "%If there's nothing that's different between `RobbersStringCipher` and `LeetStringCipher`, then what is the concept that makes them the same.\n",
    "%Think about it, they both encode in the same way.\n",
    "%One character at a time.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%To see similarities, we must sometimes look at differences.\n",
    "%Remember the reverse cipher?\n",
    "%Here's an implementation of the reverse cipher:\n",
    "%\n",
    "%```csharp\n",
    "%class ReverseCipher\n",
    "%{\n",
    "%  public string Encode (string input)\n",
    "%  {\n",
    "%    string output = \"\";\n",
    "%    for (int i=input.Length-1; i >= 0; i--)\n",
    "%      output += input[i];\n",
    "%    return output;\n",
    "%  }\n",
    "%}\n",
    "%```\n",
    "%\n",
    "%Notice how we're picking characters from the input string \"backwards\" but we're building the encoded string \"forwards\".\n",
    "%In other words we're taking characters last to first but we're building the resulting string first to last.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%The Reverse cipher algorithm is fundamentally different from the Robber's cipher and Leetspeak.\n",
    "%In the sense that it cannot (easily) be implemented as a left-to-right character-by-character conversion.\n",
    "%The first character of the input `string` *cannot* be used as input to create the first chunk of the output `string`.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%So, what's one thing that unifies the Robber's cipher and Leetspeak?\n",
    "%The encoding algorithms can both be implemented as character-by-character conversions where every input character yields one or more output characters in the correct order.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%## Composing the abstraction\n",
    "%\n",
    "%So how do we implement this?\n",
    "%In this chapter we'll use [inheritance](inheritance) but in the chapter on [abstract injected object composition](abstract-injected-object-composition) we'll use composition instead.\n",
    "%Most, including myself, would argue that the composition based solution is superior.\n",
    "%If you've ever heard about the design principle [composition over inheritance](composition-over-inheritance) you will soon start to see why this principle exists.\n",
    "%At it's core, the problem with inheritance is that it assumes that you problem forms a hierarchy.\n",
    "%Few problems are hierarchies, many are graphs.\n",
    "%But, let's go with inheritance in this chapter since we're talking about abstract dependency *construction* and not *injection*.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%What we can do with inheritance is that we can say that the method `string Encode (string input)` should be implemented in a baseclass from which other subclasses can inherit.\n",
    "%That method then delegates to a [protected](advanced-access-modifiers) instance variable which can be overwritten upon construction of subclasses.\n",
    "%Let's look at some code to make sense of this.\n",
    "%Here's the base class:\n",
    "%\n",
    "%```csharp\n",
    "%class CharWiseCipher : ICipher\n",
    "%{\n",
    "%  protected ICharCipher charCipher = new IdentityCharCipher();\n",
    "%\n",
    "%  public string Encode (string input)\n",
    "%  {\n",
    "%    string output = \"\";\n",
    "%\n",
    "%    foreach (char c in input)\n",
    "%      output += charCipher.Encode(c);\n",
    "%\n",
    "%    return output;\n",
    "%  }\n",
    "%}\n",
    "%```\n",
    "%\n",
    "%What does this baseclass do?\n",
    "%Two things:\n",
    "%\n",
    "%1. It declares and initializes the `protected` instance variable `charCipher` to a default value.\n",
    "%2. It declares and implements the instance method `string Encode (string input)` as simply passing each character of the `string` to the `Encode` method of `charCipher` and concatenating the result.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%But what is the type `IdentityCharCipher` that acts as the default value?\n",
    "%Well, we've talked about the idea of identity functions and values before.\n",
    "%The identity `char` cipher is a cipher that simply returns whatever you pass it back.\n",
    "%As you might have suspected, the class `IdentityCharCipher` is implemented something like this:\n",
    "%\n",
    "%```csharp\n",
    "%class IdentityCharCipher : ICharCipher\n",
    "%{\n",
    "%  public string Encode (char input) => input.ToString();\n",
    "%}\n",
    "%```\n",
    "%\n",
    "%Let's now look at how the baseclass `CharWiseCipher` behaves before we move on.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%```csharp\n",
    "%Console.WriteLine(new CharWiseCipher().Encode(\"Hello world\"));\n",
    "%```\n",
    "%\n",
    "%```output\n",
    "%Hello world\n",
    "%```\n",
    "%\n",
    "%Simple, and pretty pointless so far.\n",
    "%But, we can now create subclasses for each of our character-wise ciphers.\n",
    "%Each of the subclasses must, upon construction, replace the `protected` instance variable `charCipher` that's declared in the base class with whatever concrete `ICharCipher` that they need.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%```csharp\n",
    "%class LeetCipher : CharWiseCipher\n",
    "%{\n",
    "%  public LeetCipher ()\n",
    "%    => charCipher = new LeetCharCipher();\n",
    "%}\n",
    "%\n",
    "%class RobbersCipher : CharWiseCipher\n",
    "%{\n",
    "%  public RobbersCipher (char vowel)\n",
    "%    => charCipher = new RobbersCharCipher(vowel);\n",
    "%}\n",
    "%```\n",
    "%\n",
    "%Notice how utterly simple both of these ciphers now are.\n",
    "%They almost don't contain any code at all.\n",
    "%This is the power of abstraction and composition.\n",
    "%By building abstract building blocks we can trivially compose them to solve complex problems.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%Notice how the constructor of `RobbersCipher` can remain parameterized and thus still pass the parameter on to the constructor of `RobbersCharCipher`.\n",
    "%However, perhaps you remember that we, in the chapter on [concrete dependency construction](concrete-dependency-construction) cautioned that this need to pass constructor values down from type to type is a symptom of which dependency *construction* is the cause.\n",
    "%When we move to dependency *injection* this need to enable passing of constructor parameters simply goes away.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%For an overview of the code that we've built in this chapter, have a look at {numref}`fig:abstract-dependency-construction-uml`.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%```{figure} https://via.placeholder.com/500x275?text=Image+coming+soon\n",
    "%:name: fig:abstract-dependency-construction-uml\n",
    "%\n",
    "%UML class diagram of our example of abstract dependency construction.\n",
    "%```\n",
    "%\n",
    "%Isn't all this a bit overkill you might ask?\n",
    "%No, this is just the beginning.\n",
    "%The point is that now other ciphers that take a full `string` as input and performs their transformation one character at a time from left to right can subclass `CharWiseCipher` and simply, upon construction, set the instance variable to an instance that's suitable for whatever we're trying to achieve with that particular cipher.\n",
    "%\n",
    "%This means that the `LeetStringCipher` which we've now renamed to `LeetCipher` and the `RobbersStringCipher` which we've now renamed to simply `RobbersCipher` can become utterly trivial.\n",
