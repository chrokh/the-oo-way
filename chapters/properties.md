```{warning}
Work in progress.

%- Specific to some languages.
%- Synonyms: Getters / Setters, Accessors, Mutators.
%- Uniform access principle (use Robert Martin as source?)
%- Object initializers. Have already taked about them a bit in the chapter on fields.
%- Get, set, init, read-only (no setter).

%- EXAMPLE: Use Circle from fields chapter. If you change width or height then it actually changes radius. Width and height refers to bounding box.
