    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do objects come from?\n",
    "We've said that in object oriented programming we compose simple objects to solve complex problems.\n",
    "Fair enough.\n",
    "But how do we create these objects?\n",
    "Where do they come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are two types of object oriented languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class based object oriented languages.\n",
    "2. Prototype based object oriented languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the former, objects are created by instantiating classes.\n",
    "In the latter objects are created by cloning prototypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Since C# is a class based object oriented language, we won't discuss the idea of prototypes at length.\n",
    "However, you can think of it this way.\n",
    "In a prototype based object oriented language you define an object that serves as the prototypical object of some type.\n",
    "That object can then be cloned in order to create new instances of the same type.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A class defines a type.\n",
    "So, if we define a class then we're also defining a type with the same name as that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values of the type that's defined by a class are either called \"objects\"  or \"instances\" of that class.\n",
    "The words \"object\" and \"instance\" mean the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a set theory perspective, a class, just like a type, defines a set.\n",
    "The members of the set are the objects or instances of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a class in C# we simply use the keyword `class` and follow it with the identifier name that we want to use to refer to the class and hence to the type.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we, for example, wanted to define a class that models cats, we could say like this:"
