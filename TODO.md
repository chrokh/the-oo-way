# TODO

- General
  - Links to official documentation like in the [Type Systems](type-systems) chapter?
  - Add "decode" method to all usages of Caesar cipher. This is important because it helps students think about reusability.
  - Static interface methods? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/static-virtual-interface-members
- Data types
  - Should discuss Reflection?
  - Expand discussion in Data Types chapter on why treating Nullable warnings as errors is a good idea and that this should be the default.
  - Have I emphasized the importance of null reference static analysis enough?
- Compilation
  - Compiler warnings in Compilation chapter.
  - P. 49, section 4.3 of Types and Programming Languages. Bejamin Pierce. Image on how we go from characters on a file to a program that's being printed on screen.
- Indirect object composition
  - Relate to Inversion of Control (IoC).
- Object composition
  - Clarify that we are not talking about merely instantiating another object in an instance method but rather storing an object as an instance variable (meaning as a property or in a field).
  - Perhaps discussion on Dependency should be its own chapter? How does this relate to how we use the term dependency in the context of coupling?
  - "Constructed" could mean that you call someone who constructs. If the thing you call to construct is constructed in you then it's still a "hard" dependency.
  - Use term "collaborator".
- General
  - Reintroduce error code in prefix of printed errors.
  - There is no information on what "keyword" means.
- Sets
  - Perhaps "business objects" is a poor choice of words.
- Variables
  - Variables chapter missing image placeholders.
- Type-checking
  - On the purpose of types: http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2011/course/TIN321/lectures/proglang-07.html
  - More about Type Safety. How even addings strings and ints is type safe in some languages. It all depends.
    - Referera till Types and Programming Languages, Benjamin Pierce. 8.3. sid 95. Safety = Progress + Preservation.
    - Makes more sense if we divide it into compile-time type safety and run-time type safety. This makes the concept of unsafe much more sensible. It also makes the concept of uni-typed much more sensible since we can talk about compile-time uni-typed and run-time uni-typed. Not sure what compile-time poly-typed + run-time uni-typed would mean though.

    % Det korta svaret ang type safe är att ett språk som är type safe garanterar att alla program skrivna i språket är semantiskt väldefinierade. Om man t.ex. deklarerar en variabel utan att tilldela den ett värde och sen försöker använda den i C# (statiskt typat) så får man ett kompileringsfel. Om man gör samma sak i t.ex. Python eller Ruby (dynamiskt typat) så får man ett exception. Oavsett om det är ett run-time eller ett compile-time fel så är det ett språk som definierats av språket i förhand. Om det inte finns en definition i språket så är det programmet inte väldefinierat och detta

  - Brute-force hangman. Computer does guessing. You input how long the word should be and the program already has a word list stored.
  - Smart hangman. Like simple hangman but guessing computer uses word list and probability theory to make the best guesses.
