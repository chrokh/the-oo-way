    "# Factory method pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the factory method pattern is to allow objects to create new objects without being concerned about what subtypes to create nor how to actually create them.\n",
    "Said differently, it allows us to defer object construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've touted the idea of [abstract injected object composition](abstract-injected-object-composition) as the way to compose objects.\n",
    "However, we haven't addressed two obvious problems of injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What if the object that we want isn't available at the time of construction of the object that wants to use it?\n",
    "2. What if we want to be able to inject an arbitrary number of objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the classic game of Tetris for example.\n",
    "It's not like we can *inject* a `Piece` to `Board`.\n",
    "A Tetris board is ever-changing.\n",
    "As soon as we have landed one piece, the next is generated.\n",
    "Where should this piece come from?\n",
    "Do we need to instantiate a whole new board every time we want to inject a new piece?\n",
    "Or should we inject via an instance method and let someone else be responsible for sending us a piece at the right time?\n",
    "But how would they know that the time to send a new piece is now?\n",
    "Perhaps we could use the [observer pattern](observer-pattern) or [events](events) for that?\n",
    "\n",
    "All these solutions are unnecessarily complicated.\n",
    "This is where the factory method pattern comes into play.\n",
    "Instead of injecting the thing we want to use, which in the case of Tetris is the piece, we inject a factory that can produce objects of the type that we need.\n",
    "In the terminology of the [Bridge pattern](bridge-pattern), we add another layer of abstraction.\n",
    "Whenever we need a new object, we simply ask the factory for another object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of the factory method pattern from the classic design patterns book {cite:t}`gammaEtAl1995` is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- {cite:t}`gammaEtAl1995`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: Replace image.\n",
    "```{figure} https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/W3sDesign_Factory_Method_Design_Pattern_UML.jpg?20170805180321\n",
    "\n",
    "UML class diagram of factory method pattern.\n",
    "*[Image will be replaced soon]* [[Image source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:W3sDesign_Factory_Method_Design_Pattern_UML.jpg)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cipher factories\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the cipher sequences that we built in the chapter on [variant generic interfaces](variant-generic-interfaces:cipher-factories)?\n",
    "We mentioned that that essentially was an example of the factory method pattern so let's run through that example again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first make sure that we've got our cipher interface and some ciphers."
