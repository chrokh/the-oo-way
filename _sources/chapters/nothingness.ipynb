    "In imperative programming languages we usually find two kinds of nothingness: `null` and `void`.\n",
    "The former, `null`, is a value that represents the absence of a value in a variable.\n",
    "The latter, `void`, is a type that represents the absence of a value returned from an operation.\n",
    "`null` is an actual value that belongs to many types and that you can hold in a variable.\n",
    "But `void` is a type of which there are no values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we're mostly going to talk about `null` and how its treated in C#.\n",

    "## Nullable value types\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter on [data types](data-types) we modeled the type `int` as a mathematical set.\n",
    "The set did however not involve the value `null`.\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "The type `int` is what is known as a [value type](value-and-reference-semantics) and value types are, in C#, not \"nullable\".\n",
    "Being \"nullable\" means that the set that models the type also contains `null`.\n",
    "If a type is \"non-nullable\" then the set doesn't contain `null`.\n",
    "%The type `int` is not \"nullable\" which means that its type does not contain the value `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can verify that `int` is not nullable by trying to compile a program that assigns the value `null` to an `int`.\n",
    "If we do, then we get a compiler error.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "int x = null;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```output\n",
    "error CS0037: Cannot convert null to 'int' because it is a nonnullable value type.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The error message above states that the value `null` cannot be converted into an `int` since the type `int` is non-nullable.\n",
    "This means that `null` isn't a member of the set `int` and that there is no implicit conversion from `null` to `int`.\n",
    "Of course there couldn't possibly exist a general-case conversion from `null` to `int` because which integer could we possibly choose to represent the absence of an integer.\n",
    "Zero? One? Negative one?\n",
    "It all depends on context, so it is sensible that C# does not give us a general conversion from `null` to `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{seealso}\n",
    "As an aside you might be interested to know that some methods, such as `String.IndexOf`, do in fact return values that they assign special meaning to, such as negative one (`-1`), to denote the failure of an operation or the absence of a value to return.\n",
    "See [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.indexof?view=net-6.0) for more information on the IndexOf method for example.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is possible to create a nullable value type from a non-nullable value type by appending a question mark to the type name.\n",
    "This means that we are changing the type, not the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we say `int?` instead of `int` then we are dealing with a nullable value type.\n",
    "Appending a question mark works to create a nullable type works for all value types.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the set $\\mathit{int?}$ is the union of the set $\\mathit{int}$ and the `null` type which is a singleton set whose only element is $\\mathit{null}$.\n",

    "In the chapter on [Values](values) we already alluded to some of the difficulties arising from the usage of `null`.\n",
    "For now though, it is useful to keep exploring the concept of `null` as we are learning about how data types work.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Being non-nullable is not the only property of value types.\n",
    "Unless implemented otherwise, value types also have, what's known as, \"value semantics\" rather than \"reference semantics\".\n",
    "But more on this in the chapter on [value and reference semantics](value-and-reference-semantics).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, there are two categories of types in C#: value types and reference types.\n",
    "We'll talk more about what these base types are in the chapter on [value and reference type semantics](value-and-reference-semantics).\n",
    "For now, we should however mention that prior to [C# 8.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references), all reference types were nullable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also mention that when you do object oriented programming, our main building block is the object.\n",
    "And since objects are reference types, this used to mean that most of our custom types were nullable.\n",
    "If null is a billion dollar mistake, reference types are nullable, we use mostly reference types, and objects are reference types, then most of our code is subject to this billoion dollar mistake.\n",

    "## Nullable reference types\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, C# now has a setting called \"nullable reference types\" which is enabled by default in new projects since [.NET 6 (C# 10)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-reference-types).\n",
    "You can find the setting in your `.csproj` file and it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The short story is that, with this setting turned on, reference types are no longer nullable.\n",
    "However, if you try to assign the literal `null` to a variable that's of a reference type you don't actually get a type error but simply a compiler warning.\n",
    "This warning is emitted from a static code analysis procedure known as null state analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the reference type `string` for example.\n",
    "Let's say we declare a variable of type `string` and initialize it to the value `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string s = null;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have the setting for nullable reference types turned on, then we get the following warning upon compilation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```output\n",
    "warning CS8600: Converting null literal or possible null value to non-nullable type.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the error message is referring to the variable of type `string` as being non-nullable.\n",
    "The error message is structured exactly like a type error.\n",
    "If, for example, we tried to assign a value of type `int` to a variable of type `string` we would get an error message with the same structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```output\n",
    "error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type 'int' to 'string'.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, in the case where we assign a null literal to a value of the non-nullable reference type string this is not a type error in the classic sense.\n",
    "For one, it's a warning and not an error.\n",
    "But also, this is a warning that's emitted upon null state analysis and not by type checking.\n",
    "As we shall see soon, null state analysis is a much more complicated procedure than type-checking.\n",
    "In [type-checking](type-checking) we simply check whether the type of a value is the same as, or is [implicitly convertible](type-conversions) to, a value of the expected type.\n",
    "If `null` is a legal value of the expected type, or if it is possible to implicitly convertible to a value of the expected type then the program simply type-checks.\n",
    "In null state analysis however, we look at the actual flow of the program in attempts to verify whether a value might ever contain the value `null`.\n",
    "If the compiler cannot guarantee that `null` is not ever used where a certain reference type is expected it will emit a warning upon compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it isn't entirely honest to call `string` non-nullable since we are still able to compile and run programs that uses `null` where values of type `string` are expected.\n",
    "It's not that `null` isn't a valid member of the set underlying each reference type or that there no longer exists an implicit conversion from `null` to the type in question.\n",
    "It's that whenever you try to assign `null` to a non-nullable reference type you simply get a compiler warning.\n",
    "You can still compile the program and it might run just fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "%Before we move forward we should make one distinction clear.\n",
    "%I use sets and types to reason about how we change the permitted values of reference types but null-state analysis is not the same as any old type-checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while both value types and reference types are non-nullable the way they are so differs in two important ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Value types are non-nullable regardless of whether we turn on the `Nullable` setting or not. The `Nullable` setting only affects the nullability of reference types.\n",
    "2. A program that assigns `null` to a value type can *not* be compiled while a program that assigns `null` to a reference type *can* be. In the case of value types you get a compilation error but in the case of reference types you only get a warning.\n",
    "3. Assigning `null` to a value type causes an error at type-checking while assigning `null` to a non-nullable reference type causes a warning during null-state analysis if that code can be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third point can be driven home by asking yourself why one of the examples below is a compileable program while the other is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string s = \"\";\n",
    "if (false)\n",
    "  s = null;\n",

    "warning CS0162: Unreachable code detected\n",
    "\n",
    "Build succeeded.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case above, we generate unreachable code (line 3).\n",
    "Since the statement that assigns `null` to our non-nullable variable isn't ever executed this is compileable (but pointless).\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare this to the case below where we try to assign `null` to a value type but wrap it in a conditional that's always false which means that it will never happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",

    "error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type 'int' to 'string'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we get a type-error even if the code cannot ever be reached.\n",
    "This is because the error is emitted by type-checking rather than null-state static analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{seealso}\n",
    "In the [C# manual](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/nullable-warnings) you can find a summary of all the warnings you can get as a consequence of enabling nullable reference types.\n",

    "## Null-state static analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The null-state static analysis of the C# compiler is actually quite sophisticated.\n",
    "According to [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references), the compiler can tag a variable as `not-null` in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If a variable has been assigned a value that is known to not be `null`.\n",
    "2. If a variable has already been checked against `null` and has not been modified since.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all other cases, the variable is tagged as `maybe-null`.\n",
    "Or in other words, in all other cases, the compiler cannot guarantee that the variable doesn't contain the value `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "%I know we haven't talked about [methods](static-methods) yet, but if for example you have a method that takes a nullable parameter then you cannot guarantee that callers of your method will not send you `null`.\n",
    "%Therefore the compiler must tag the variable inside the method as `not-null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to convert a value contained in a variable which has been tagged as `maybe-null` to a non-nullable type then we must first check whether the value actually is `null`.\n",
    "Only if we can show that the value isn't in fact `null` are we allowed to convert the value into a type which is non-nullable.\n",
    "If we don't check first then the compiler will complain and we'll get a warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take, for example, the concept of reading input from the user using the method `Console.ReadLine`.\n",
    "If we read the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console.readline?view=net-6.0) for the method then we can see that it doesn't return a `string` but a `string?`.\n",
    "Meaning it doesn't return a non-nullable string but a nullable string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the documentation we can see that we get `null` when there are no more lines available to read from standard input.\n",
    "When we are running our program interactively and the user types in a response to our `Console.ReadLine` call then we never actually see `null`.\n",
    "However, since it can occurr if we run the program non-interactively the compiler cannot guarantee that the result of `Console.ReadLine` is not `null` in our program and hence cannot tag the result as `not-null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "string? x = Console.ReadLine();\n",
    "string y = x;\n",
    "```\n",

    "We merely get a compiler warning.\n",
    "In the next section we will however see how we can turn these warnings into errors which means that we no longer need the air quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, but is it possible to convert a nullable reference type to a non-nullable reference type if the value is tagged as `not-null`?\n",
    "Yes, it is.\n",
    "In the example below, we assign the variable `x` a literal string and not `null`.\n",
    "This causes `x` to be tagged as `not-null` which means that we can safely and implicitly convert our `string?` which is nullable to a `string` which is non-nullable.\n",

    "No, not at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we said that the compiler's static null-state analysis can tag a variable as `not-null` if we've \"checked it against `null`\"?\n",
    "What does this mean?\n",
    "It simply means that we take our variable, stick it in a conditional, and check if the value of our variable is `null`.\n",

Så det handlar alltså snarare om huruvida vi resonerar på ett meningsfullt och rimligt sätt. Vilket jag tycker att du i stora drag gör. Jag tänker dock enligt nedan och det är den bild jag tafatt försökte förmedla under föreläsningen :)\n",

Mängden `Int?` (alltså `Nullable<Int>`) är då unionen av `Int` och `Null`. Elementet `null` tillhör inte mängden `Int` men tillhör mängden `Int?`.\n",

    "%4) Om vi vill hade vi dock kunnat resonera om värdet `null` i `String` som om det var av en annan typ eftersom det speciella värdet faktiskt inte stödjer några operationer som övriga värden i `String` tillåter. Men det har jag inte (med mening) gjort under föreläsningen. Det jag däremot har sagt är att när vi kör med statisk analysis så beter sig kompilatorn nästan som om det gällde att `String` inte innehåller `null` och `String?` är unionen av `Null` och `String`.\n",
