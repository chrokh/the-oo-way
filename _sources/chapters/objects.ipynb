    "\n",
    "Let us now explore the idea of objects.\n",
    "In the next chapter we will talk about [classes](classes) but let's now focus strictly on objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO:\n",
    "%- Somewhere I should deal with the question of what it means and whether it was a good thing or not that OO systems became increasingly concerned with Abstract Data Types rather than objects. Here are some links:\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In procedural programming, the building block is the [procedure](method-composition).\n",
    "**In object oriented programming, the building block is the object.**\n",
    "In procedural programming, we solve complex problems by composing simple procedures.\n",
    "In object oriented programming, we solve complex problems by composing simple objects.\n",
    "[Object composition](object-composition) is something that we'll discuss at length in future chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "The fundamental building block in object oriented programming is the object.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we, in the chapter on [methods](methods), discussed that with methods as the only abstraction and method composition as the only tool (and assuming that we don't have access to things such as parametric polymorphism and higher order functions) we will be forced to eventually turn methods into data to increase abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I mean is that to increase the modularity of our code, and hence eliminate duplication, we will have to take things that might otherwise be expressed as methods and somehow convert them into data that methods can operate upon.\n",
    "In other words, instead of just implementing whatever code we want to implement as a method, we have to figure out how to represent some key step or steps (where there are multiple possible algorithms) as a data type that we then can accept as a parameter.\n",
    "When passing different values as arguments we get different behavior.\n",
    "All this for the purpose of eliminating duplication by increasing abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of this is how we, in the chapter on [methods](methods-substitutions), found ourselves in a position where it was difficult to increase abstraction and eliminate duplication without expressing part of the algorithm as data.\n",
    "We figured out that some ciphers are substitution ciphers and that the substitutions that any particular cipher performs can be expressed as an array of pairs containing a pattern and a replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of being able to write algorithms called `robbersEncodeString`, `leetEncodeString`, and so forth, we had to write a method called `substitute` that accepted a list of substitutions instead.\n",
    "The substitutions are now data instead of being part of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not necessarily a bad thing.\n",
    "It all depends on what you want to achieve and what you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes it's really difficult to find a sensible way of representing an algorithm as data.\n",
    "Not all algorithms can trivially be represented as data.\n",
    "In the case of substitution ciphers it happened to be simple.\n",
    "But some algorithms are arguably easier to express as methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in the days, this is where function pointers would come into play.\n",
    "But, pointers are not [type safe](type-safety) and by now I'm hoping that you're convinced that static type safety is really important.\n",
    "So, let's not dwell on the archeic concept of function pointers.\n",
    "But what then?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, this is where objects enter the scene.\n",
    "Objects allow us to bundle up some data with some methods and then *send that bundle* around.\n",
    "As we will learn, objects allow [subtype polymorphism](subtype-polymorphism) and hence [dynamic dispatch](dynamic-dispatch) without loosing static type safety.\n",
    "This in turn allows us to keep increasing abstraction without having to resort to turning more and more algorithms into data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "In the coming chapters we will mostly focus on the idea of writing the substitution algorithms ourselves rather than turning the substitutions into data.\n",
    "But rest assured that when we're done rewriting this in a more object oriented fashion we'll also be able to support both ideas at the same time.\n",
    "So if you really liked the idea of substitution ciphers, don't worry.\n",
    "%Pretty neat, right?\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is an object?\n",
    "Well, there's basically two camps.\n",
    "The fundamentalists and the practical bunch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamentalists hold that objects are (possibly stateful) agents that you can interact with by sending messages and receiving responses.\n",
    "They hold that message passing is a philosophy, and that by following the way of the message we will write better programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical bunch, argue that an object is just a bunch of methods (known as [instance methods](instance-methods)) that operate on some [encapsulated](encapsulation) state (known as [instance fields](fields)).\n",
    "\n",
    "I myself happen to symphatize with the more practical view.\n",
    "There's nothing magical, mystical, or philosophical about object oriented programming.\n",
    "It's just a way of giving us [single dynamic dispatch](dynamic-dispatch) by means of [subtype polymorphism](subtype-polymorphism) without loosing [static type-safety](type-safety).\n",
    "If that sentence doesn't make any sense to you, don't worry.\n",
    "When you're done reading this book, it will.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects mix methods and data in order to hide the data that belongs to a particular object so that other objects cannot accidentally change it.\n",
    "This is known as \"encapsulation\" or \"information hiding\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The two terms are, today, often considered synonymous.\n",
    "Originally though, they may have been used to describe different things.\n",
    "If you are interested in learning more about the different definitions of *encapsulation* and *information hiding* I highly recomend reading this answer on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39499367).\n",
    "\n",
    "The short story is that encapsulation sometimes simply refers to the idea of mixing methods and data, while information hiding sometimes more specifically refers to the idea of making the object that encapsulates the data the only one able to change the data.\n",
    "In other words, information hiding makes it impossible for data in an object to be changed by objects of other types.\n",
    "The following saying is a cheeky way to remember the idea of information hiding:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "Hide your private parts.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that objects encapsulate or hide state.\n",
    "That they hide their private parts.\n",
    "That objects are a set of methods that operate on some encapsulated state?\n",
    "But what do we mean by all this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we're passing around two integers that correspond to some `x` and `y` coordinates of some `player` in some game that we're building.\n",
    "Let's then say that we've got a bunch of methods like `moveEast` and `moveNorthEast` that we use to update these coordinates.\n",
    "Doing this the object oriented way we would encapsulate the `x` and `y` coordinates in an object whose type we might call `Position`.\n",
    "We might also encapsulate the position object itself in an object whose type we might call `Player`.\n",
    "The methods `moveEast` and `moveNorthEast` would now likely become instance methods on the objects of type `Player` and `Position`.\n",
    "These instance methods update the state that's been encapsulated in the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "%They refer to the idea of hiding implementation details that are likely to change inside an object.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is my duty however, to mention that some authors, like Robert C. Martin (see for example {cite:t}`martin2017`), argues that the mixing of methods and data isn't unique to object oriented programming.\n",
    "Instead, he proposes that the defining feature of object oriented languages is that they make subtype polymorphism type safe at compile-time.\n",
    "This is the same argument we made in the motivation section of this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message passing\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so what is this idea of message passing?\n",
    "Pessimistically, a message is nothing more than a call to an [instance method](instance-methods).\n",
    "We'll talk about instance methods in a separate chapter but in short, they are just regular methods that are executed within the context of the state of an object.\n",
    "Meaning that instance methods have access to and can mutate the state of the object it is invoked upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A message is sent from a sender to a receiver.\n",
    "We commonly think of the message as having a name (i.e., the name of the method) and possibly some payload (i.e., the arguments of the method).\n",
    "The receiving object may choose what to do in response to the message and may choose to provide a response to the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/message-passing.png\n",
    "---\n",
    "name: fig:message-passing\n",
    "---\n",
    "Objects can send messages to other objects as well as reply to messages sent to them.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since objects encapsulate state, the messages can contain or be based upon state from the object.\n",
    "In {numref}`fig:message-passing` we are implying that both the name and the mood of the object on the left is part of its state.\n",
    "If its state was different, its answers to the messages might be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about the more philosophical view of messages?\n",
    "Alan Kay, a pioneer and vocal advocate of object oriented program, has argued that message passing is a more important idea than objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term \"objects\" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea. The big idea is \"messaging\".\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Alan Kay [[source]](http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way.\n",
    "The difference between message passing and simply invoking a method lies in thinking of the object that sends the message as an ambassador of information.\n",
    "In 2016, Alan Kay was doing an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11945722).\n",
    "When someone asked a question related to the validity of the assumptions of the object oriented paradigm, Alan Kay responded by saying:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "What if \"data\" is a really bad idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Alan Kay, in an AMA discussion on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11945722).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This somewhat controversial statement of course sparked debate.\n",
    "Rich Hickey, inventor of the programming language Closure, entered the debate to defend the opposing view.\n",
    "It is truly remarkable that we get to observe as these giants discuss this fundamental topic so if your interest happens to be peaked then I highly recommend having a look at the full conversation.\n",
    "At one point in the conversation Alan Kay proclaims that:\n",
    "\n",
    "%In one of the more heated debates of modern object oriented times Alan Kay and Rich Hickey (inventor of the programming language Closure) argued about the usefulness of sending data without an interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "For important negotiations we don't send telegrams, we send ambassadors.\n",
    "\n",

    "Think about this quote.\n",
    "What does it mean?\n",
    "We shouldn't send data to methods, we should send objects that we can talk to and that themselves have access to the data.\n",
    "We should send an ambassador of information, not \"raw\" data.\n",
    "A message is data as interpreted by an ambassador of that message.\n",
    "\n",
    "These quotes and the heat of that debate hopefully conveys the point of how some defenders of object oriented programming truly are more philosophical than practical.\n",
    "This is why I'm cautioning you that some defenders of object oriented programming are, with all due respect, quite like fundamentalists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Whether messages and objects are good ideas or not is up for debate.\n",
    "I myself happen to believe that the declarative (specifically the functional) paradigm is the future and that these philosophical discussions around message passing and objects might be a misguided distraction that doesn't bear enough fruit.\n",
    "%Nevertheless, I think it captures the philosophical view of messages quite nicely.\n",
    "In regards to the question of sending ambassadors, I suggest that you ask yourself whether multiple interpretations of the same piece of raw data perhaps is not a bug, but a useful feature?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "### Messages can contain objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Any or all of the arguments (meaning the input) as well as the response (meaning the output) might be objects.\n",
    "So objects can contain objects.\n",
    "We'll talk more about this when we get to [object composition](object-composition).\n",
    "In fact, in a *purely* (here we don't mean pure as in referentially transparent) object oriented language (such as Smalltalk) any arguments and any responses *must* be objects since all [values](values) are objects, but we'll return to that technical detail in the [Discussion](#discussion) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Herein lies the idea of the \"interpreter\" that follows with the \"data\" that Alan Kay talked about above.\n",
    "In the non-object oriented world we pass around, let's call it, \"raw\" data.\n",
    "This means that everytime we want to do something with the data we have to interpret it.\n",
    "In the object-oriented world however, we pass around data together with an interpreter.\n",
    "The interpreter is the object and the data is contained within the object.\n",
