    "# Subtype polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: Move intro to its own chapter. So that we don't have to talk about other types of polymorphism in the chapter on subtype polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The time has come to talk about subtype polymorphism.\n",
    "If you haven't studied polymorphism before, let me just spill the beans and tell you that this is, arguably, *the most important idea in object oriented programming*.\n",
    "Luckily it is also the most mind-bendingly interesting topic in object oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "Polymorphism allows us to explicitly or implicitly define a contract that multiple different types can implement.\n",
    "This allows us to use these different types interchangeably without needing to be concerned about which particular type we have.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: Source for translation?\n",
    "The word \"polymorphism\" comes from Greek and means \"many-shaped\".\n",
    "There are many types of polymorphism and in this chapter we're specifically talking about subtype polymorphism.\n",
    "Which types of polymorphism exists depends on who you ask but I tend to follow the division of {cite:t}`cardelliAndWegner1985` where we have the following four types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Parametric polymorphism](generics).\n",
    "2. Inclusion / subtype / overriding polymorphism.\n",
    "3. [Overloading polymorphism](overloading).\n",
    "4. [Coercion polymorphism](object-type-conversions).\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: The chapter on generics also uses the terms static vs dynamic polymorphism. So perhaps that must be introduced here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will talk about subtype polymorphism.\n",
    "In previous chapters we have already talked about [overloading](overloading) without calling it overloading polymorphism.\n",
    "In a coming chapter on [object type conversions](object-type-conversions) we will talk about \"implicit type conversions\" which is what coercion polymorphism tends to refer to.\n",
    "Finally, we will also talk about parametric polymorphism in the chapter on [generics](generics) since this is what the C# implementation of the concept is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "When someone just says \"polymorphism\" in the context of a discussion around object oriented programming they are most likely referring to subtype polymorphism.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand subtype/inclusion polymorphism we must understand the idea of subtyping or of inclusion.\n",
    "Think back to the notion of subsets from the chapter on [sets](sets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we've got a set of cats that we call $\\mathit{Cat}$ and a set of dogs that we call $\\mathit{Dog}$.\n",
    "If we claim that $\\mathit{Cat}$ and $\\mathit{Dog}$ are *subtypes* of $\\mathit{Animal}$ then we are claiming that they are subsets of $\\mathit{Animal}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathit{Cat} \\subset \\mathit{Animal}\\\\\n",
    "\\mathit{Dog} \\subset \\mathit{Animal}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of *subsets* this means that all members of the set $\\mathit{Cat}$ are also members of the set $\\mathit{Animal}$.\n",
    "Same for dogs.\n",
    "Have a look back in the chapter on [sets](sets) if this isn't obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of *subtypes* however this means that a $\\mathit{Cat}$ can be used at any point where an $\\mathit{Animal}$ is expected.\n",
    "Same for dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite of a subtype is called a \"supertype\".\n",
    "Instead of the subtype-supertype terminology you will also often find the pairs child type-parent type, and base type-derived type.\n",
    "The terminology is summarized in {numref}`tbl:subtype-supertype-terminology`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{table} Alternatives to the subtype-supertype terminology.\n",
    ":name: tbl:subtype-supertype-terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "| Supertype | Subtype |\n",
    "| :--: | :--: |\n",
    "| Parent type | Child type |\n",
    "| Base type | Derived type |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Substitutability\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of being able to use some type instead of another is known as \"substitutability\".\n",
    "We'll talk more about what ought to be substitutable for what in the chapter on [Liskov's substitution principle](liskov-substitution-principle).\n",
    "In general however, this means that the *state and behavior* of any subtype must be a legal state and behavior of its supertype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the two types `Cat` and `Dog` are subtypes of `Animal`.\n",
    "Inversely, `Animal` is a supertype of both `Cat` and `Dog`.\n",
    "This means that any value of type `Cat` and any value of type `Dog` must at all times be legal states and behaviors given our definition of `Animal`.\n",
    "In other words, all dogs and all cats must at all times, with no exceptions, behave like animals.\n",
    "If this condition is satisfied then we are free to declare that `Dog` and `Cat` are subtypes of `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we, way back in the chapter on [data types](run-time-and-compile-time-types), said that the type on the left doesn't necessarily have to be the same as the type on the right?\n",
    "Or in other words, how the compile-time type doesn't necessarily have to be the same as the run-time type.\n",
    "Well, let's unpack that statement now.\n",
    "Have a look at this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "Animal a1 = new Cat();\n",
    "Animal a2 = new Dog();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The left-hand type, the compile-time type, of both variables is `Animal`.\n",
    "However, the right-hand type, the run-time type, is `Cat` for one of the variables and `Dog` for the other.\n",
    "For this code to compile `Cat` and `Dog` must both be subtypes of `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's generalize.\n",
    "A run-time type can be used if the run-time type is the same as the expected compile-time type or if the run-time type is a subtype of the compile-time type.\n",
    "In other words, whenever we state that a certain compile-time type is expected we can use values that at run-time have exactly that type or any subtype of that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nominal subtyping\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we, in the chapter on [type systems](type-systems), discussed that a type system is either nominal, structural or some combination of the two.\n",
    "If a type system is nominal, then subtyping is determined based on the fact that we declare that it is.\n",
    "In a structural type system however, subtyping is determined on the basis of the structure of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "C# is a nominally typed language, and hence implements nominal subtyping.\n",
    "A subtype is a subtype if we nominally declare that it is.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the existence of [exceptions](exceptions) means that it is quite simple to nominally declare that something is a subtype yet structurally violate the rules of, what is known as, \"behavioral subtyping\".\n",
    "More on this in the chapter on the [Liskov substitution principle](liskov-substitution-principle) (LSP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Type systems that implement structural subtyping often need to deal with whether or not to support both \"width subtyping\" and \"depth subtyping\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```{seealso}\n",
    "The static type checker [Flow](https://flow.org) for the language JavaScript is an example of a type system that supports both depth subtyping and width subtyping.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: \"In a language with structural subtyping, a type U is a subtype of T if its methods and fields are a superset of Tâ€™s methods and fields. The interface of a class is simply its public fields and methods; there is no need to declare a separate interface type. In a language with nominal subtyping, on the other hand, U is a subtype of T if and only if it is declared to be. Accordingly, structural subtyping can be considered intrinsic, while nominal subtyping is declarative. Each kind of subtyping has its merits, but a formal model has not been developed for a language that integrates the two subtyping disciplines.\"\n",
    "% https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/ecoop08.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "% TODO: \"We say that T is a subtype of U (written T<:U) if all operations allowed on values of type U are allowed on values of type T.\"\n",
    "% https://www.ifazk.com/blog/2018-11-26-Bounded-field-typing.html\n",
    "% Discussed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/a1bfa7/depthsubtyping_and_mutation/\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we declare one type a subtype of another type?\n",
    "Well, in C#, and many other object oriented langauges, there are usually two ways.\n",
    "A subtype relationship can be established by either:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Interface implementation](interfaces), or\n",
    "2. [Inheritance](inheritance).\n",
    "\n",
    "If type `A` implements the `interface` defined by type `B` then `A` is considered a subtype of `B`.\n",
    "If type `A` inherits from the class or abstract class `B` then `A` is a subtype of `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore how to create subtype relationships by means of inheritance in the chapter on [inheritance](inheritance).\n",
    "In this chapter we will focus on how to create subtype relationships by means of interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notationally you will often find the less-than-sign (`<`) being used to denote subtyping.\n",
    "Where the subtype is on the left and the supertype is on the right.\n",
    "In C# however we tend to use the same symbol as for [interface](interfaces) implementation and [inheritance](inheritance), namely colon (`:`).\n",
    "The subtype is still on the left, and the supertype on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cat : Animal\n",
    "Dog : Animal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "If you happen to already be familiar with [inheritance](inheritance) it is important to realize that subtype does not *necessarily* mean subclass.\n",
    "While a subtype can be created by means of inheritance it can also be created by means of interface implementation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(dynamic-dispatch)=\n",
    "### Dynamic dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "But what does all this matter you ask?\n",
    "Why would I want to \"treat\" cats and dogs as animals instead of as cats and dogs?\n",
    "Well, the answer lies in something known as \"dynamic dispatch\".\n",
    "\n",
    "By declaring that `Cat` and `Dog` both implement the interface `IAnimal` we can use `IAnimal` as the compile-time type.\n",
    "Importantly we can call whatever methods and access whatever properties the type `IAnimal` declares.\n",
    "However, we can do this without having to care at all about which particular implementation of `IAnimal` we happen to get at runtime.\n",
    "As long as whatever members we're accessing are defined in `IAnimal` then we are guaranteed that these members will be available in all subtypes of `IAnimal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before leaving the section on dynamic dispatch I should also mention that most languages that implement dynamic dispatch by means of subtype polymorphism provide us with *single* dynamic dispatch.\n",
    "This means that the implementation that is executed depends on the run-time type of one variable.\n",
    "We will learn about *multiple* dynamic dispatch in the chapters on [visitor pattern](visitor-pattern) and [pattern matching](pattern-matching).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that subtype polymorphism doesn't require constructors to have any particular signature.\n",
    "As we will see in the chapter on [inheritance](inheritance), inheriting from a class will force you to call one of the base classes constructor (albeit possibly implicitly) but you're nevertheless able to define your own constructors in the subclass.\n",
    "In the case of interfaces we're only demanding that implementors define some public instance members.\n",
    "The constructors can consequently vary wildly between different implementations of an interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beyond inclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter on [interfaces](interfaces) and here we've emphasized the importance of letting the supertype be the [intersection](intersection) of all the subtypes, not the [union](union) of them.\n",
    "Otherwise we would force subtypes to provide implementations for members they have no sensible implementation for.\n",
    "This is a path that leads to a sea of run-time errors.\n",
    "So let us agree to stray away before it is too late.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you get the idea that you should put members that are exclusive to some set of subtypes in the supertype?\n",
    "Well, when we treat something as it's supertype then we can *only* access whatever members are defined in that supertype.\n",
    "It doesn't matter what additional members might exist in the subtype.\n",
    "We only know about what's in the compile-time type."
