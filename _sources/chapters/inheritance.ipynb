    "# Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Work in progress.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance, in object oriented languages, tend to serve two purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a subtype to either inherit or [override](overriding) instance members from its supertype.\n",
    "2. Inheritance causes the subtype to be substitutable for the supertype in the sense of subtype polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already discussed the benefits of subtype polymorphism in the chapters on [interfaces](interfaces) and [subtype polymorphism](subtype-polymorphism).\n",
    "We have thus already dealt with the second point above, and will in this chapter therefore mostly focus on the first.\n",
    "Namely, that of using inheritance to eliminate duplication by allowing subclasses to use code from its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is of *vital importance* to realize that these two purposes always go hand-in-hand.\n",
    "Whenever we declare that a subclass inherits from a superclass, then we are always and without exception also declaring that the former is a subtype of the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, inheritance always leads to subtype polymorphism which means that we must take care not violate the [Liskov substitution principle](liskov-substitution-principle) or else we are in for a world of hurt.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{danger}\n",
    "Inheritance must *not* blindly be used for *code reuse* without respecting the rules of substitutability.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a binary directed relationship between two (possibly [abstract](abstract-classes)) classes or [interfaces](interface-inheritance).\n",
    "Similar to the terminology used in [subtype polymorphism](subtype-polymorphism) we refer to the two parties as sub/child/derived class/type and super/parent/base class/type.\n",
    "The subclass inherits both type and members from its superclass.\n",
    "We'll discuss abstract classes in a separate chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare that a class is a subclass of another class in C# we use the same syntax as we use when declaring that the class implements some [interface](interfaces).\n",
    "In other words, we write a colon (`:`) after the class name and then the name of the superclass.\n",
    "In the example below, we declare that the class `Child` inherits from the class `Parent`."
