    "# Advanced access modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing the [basic access modifiers](basic-access-modifiers) `public` and `private` we mentioned that many object oriented languages have another modifier known as `protected`.\n",
    "More specifically, if a language supports [inheritance](inheritance) it probably also supports the access modifier `protected`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why another modifier?\n",
    "Well, remember how `private` members only are accessible from wihtin the class they are defined in?\n",
    "The introduction of `protected` stems from the realization that in a language that supports [inheritance](inheritance) you might also want members that are private within a given inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap the definitions that we gave in the chapter on [basic access modififers](basic-access-modifiers)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `public` means accessible by whoever has access to the class.\n",
    "- `private` means accessible *only* from within the class itself.\n",
    "- `protected` means accessible *only* from within the class itself *and* any of its [subclasses](inheritance).\n",
    "\n",
    "A `protected` member is therefore like a `private` member except that it is `private` to the whole inheritance hierarchy below the type in which it is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### UML class diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "In UML class diagrams we use the symbol `#` to denote `protected`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's keep working with the sequences that we defined in the chapter on [inheritance](inheritance).\n",
    "In the superclass `Sequence` we marked the `get` accessor of the property `Current` as `public` but the `set` accessor as `private`.\n",
    "Now that we know that we should hide [implementation](encapsulation) details in object oriented programming, it makes sense to encapsulate the write rights to the `Current` property.\n",
    "If we change the accessibility of the `set` accessor to `protected` we are suddenly able to access that property in all subclasses of `Sequence`."
