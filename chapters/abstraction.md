(abstraction)=
# Abstraction

- Methods, classes, types.
- Implementation details.
- Solve problems by composing (combining) abstractions rather than having to be bothered with all the nitty gritty all the time.
- Analog examples:
  - Electrical wall outlet. You don't need to know anything about voltage or amps to use them.
  - Cars. You just fill them up and drive. Automatic transmission is a good example.
- Section 4.3 in {cite:et}`ousterhout2018`.
- Interfaces in the abstraction-sense of the word. In the input-output-how-to-interact-with sense of the word.
