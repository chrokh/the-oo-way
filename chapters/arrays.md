# Arrays

```{warning}
Work in progress.
```

%- Highlight the problems that we will solve later.
%- Accessing individual elements vs iterating. Lead into iteration chapter.
%- Bracket notation.
%- Will look at lists later.
%- Collection initializer (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers)
%- Reference types and if you mutate one reference all references to that value change. This is back-referenced in the chapter on fields.
