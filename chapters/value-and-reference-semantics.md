# Value and reference semantics

- Perhaps use type hierarchy fig from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/
- Implications for equivalence, mutability, and copying (passing and changing).
- Reference types that behave like value types
- Example: Arrays are passed by reference and are mutable.
- Value types and reference types are the two main categories of types in C# 
- All this is a bit of a mess.
- Relation to boxing.
