    "# Abstract constructed object composition\n",
    "\n",
    "%**TODO: Skip sequence (first discussed in the chapter on Inheritance, but then also Abstract classes) can usefully be implemented by holding a reference to a Sequence that you progress twice. This way you can skip in any sequence. Carry this example over to injection chapter.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Prerequisites\n",
    ":class: info\n",
    "In this chapter weâ€™re exploring the object composition abstraction level that we refer to as \"abstract constructed object composition\". Please have a look at the chapter [object composition](object-composition:abstraction-levels) if you have not already.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "%In truth, there isn't much to say about abstract constructed object composition.\n",
    "%I would be so bold as to suggest that it is quite uncommon that we find ourselves in a position where abstract constructed object composition is a useful solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "%Let's think about it.\n",
    "If an object composition is *constructed* then that means that the composing object is the one who *instantiates* (think: calls the constructor of) the composed.\n",
    "If the object composition is *abstract* then that means that the *compile-time type* of the constructed object is *abstract*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the term \"abstract\" in the sense of an \"abstraction\", which means an [interface](interfaces) or an [abstract class](abstract-classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, abstract constructed object composition only makes sense if we want to use the power of subtype polymorphism within a class but don't want to let others outside choose what object or objects from that subtyping hierarchy we use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "%### Sequences\n",
    "%\n",
    "%Remember the example of number sequences from the chapters on [inheritance](inheritance), and [abstract classes](abstract-classes)?\n",
    "%We ended up with an abstract superclass called `Sequence`:\n",

    "%  {\n",

    "%}\n",
    "%```\n",

    "% TODO: Perhaps a RandomSequenceFactory is a good example? Can give forward reference to factory method pattern chapter and this isn't better solved using injection since we cannot inject and reuse the same sequence over and over again. Because they have state! This is great EXCEPT FOR THAT IT ISN'T ACTUALLY AN EXAMPLE OF COMPOSITION SINCE WE IMMEDIATELY RETURN THE OBJECTS! SOLUTION: I should simply rename all these four concepts so that we talk about ABSTRACT INJECTED ASSOCIATION instead of object composition. That is more flexible and UML association seems to mean exactly what we mean. All forms of type A has a relationship with type B. This is probably wrong. See mail discussion on the subject.\n",
