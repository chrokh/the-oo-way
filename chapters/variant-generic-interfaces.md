# Variant generic interfaces

[Generic interfaces](generic-supertypes) are a staple in C#. They enable us to write type-agnostic code while maintaining type safety.
Another hallmark in programming is the concept of [variance](variance) which allows us to be more flexible with type assignments.
Combining these two leads to enormously reusable code.

```{admonition} Key point
C# supports variance for generic interfaces with the `in` and `out` keywords.
The keyword `out` is for covariant "output", while the keyword `in` is for contravariant "input".
Not specifying any of them results in invariance.
```

- Prefixing a type parameter with the keyword `out` makes it [covariant](covariance).
- Prefixing a type parameter with the keyword `in` makes it [contravariant](contravariance).
- Not prefixing a type parameter with any of these kewywords makes it [invariant](invariance).

```{important}
Using `out` and `in` with generic interfaces is not about altering the behavior of the interface itself. Instead, it's about providing flexibility in type assignments, making your types more adaptable.
```


## Covariance using `out`

In a universe of geometric shapes, every shape has an area. Some shapes, like circles, have specific properties like a radius. Let's represent this in code:

```{code-cell}
class Shape
{
    public virtual double Area { get; set; }
}
```

```{code-cell}
class Circle : Shape
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }
    public override double Area => Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
}
```

In this world, let's consider a scenario where we often work with pairs of shapes. We create a covariant, read-only pair:

```{code-cell}
interface IPair<out T>
{
    T First { get; }
    T Second { get; }
}
```

Now, let's also define a `Pair<T>` class:

```{code-cell}
class Pair<T> : IPair<T>
{
    public T First { get; }
    public T Second { get; }

    public Pair(T first, T second)
    {
        First = first;
        Second = second;
    }
}
```

Here's where the magic happens. Let's say we have a method that calculates the total area of a pair of shapes:

```{code-cell}
double TotalArea(IPair<Shape> shapePair)
    => shapePair.First.Area + shapePair.Second.Area;
```

Even though this method expects a pair of `Shape` objects, due to the covariance enabled by `out`, we can pass in a pair of `Circle` objects:

```{code-cell}
IPair<Circle> pair = new Pair<Circle>(
        new Circle { Radius = 5 },
        new Circle { Radius = 3 });

double combinedArea = TotalArea(pair);
```

This is the essence of covariance: the ability to use a more derived type (like `Circle`) where a less derived type (like `Shape`) is expected. In this case, a method designed for general shapes can seamlessly compute the area for specific circle pairs.

```{tip}
When you see the `out` keyword in a generic interface, think of it as "outputting" data, which aligns with returning values, hence its association with return types.
```

## Contravariance using `in`

Contravariance is the opposite of covariance. It allows a more general type to be used where a more specific type is expected. This might sound counterintuitive, but itâ€™s incredibly powerful in certain scenarios.

Consider, forinstance, this general interface that we can use for comparing the "size" of any two objects.
Notice how the type parameter `T` is marked as being contravariant.

```{code-cell}
interface IComparer<in T>
{
    bool IsGreaterThan(T left, T right);
}
```

Let's then define a type that implements this interface for any `Shape`.
The implementation compares `Shape`s based on their `Area`.

```{code-cell}
class ShapeAreaComparer : IComparer<Shape>
{
    public bool IsGreaterThan(Shape x, Shape y)
        => x.Area > y.Area;
}
```

With contravariance, we can use this general `Shape` comparer even if we need a more specific comparer like `IComparer<Circle>`:

```{code-cell}
IComparer<Circle> circleComparer = new ShapeAreaComparer();
```

At first glance this might not seem like a big deal. But again, consider that these objects might be found inside other structures. Let's reintroduce the notion of a `Pair<T>`.

```{code-cell}
class Pair<T> : IPair<T>
{
    public T First { get; }
    public T Second { get; }

    public Pair(T first, T second)
    {
        First = first;
        Second = second;
    }

    public T Largest (IComparer<T> comparer)
    {
        if (comparer.IsGreaterThan(Second, First))
            return Second;
        else
            return First;
    }
}
```

```{code-cell}
Pair<Circle> pair = new Pair<Circle>(
        new Circle { Radius = 3 },
        new Circle { Radius = 5 });

Circle largest = pair.Largest(new ShapeAreaComparer());

Console.WriteLine(largest.Radius);
```

```{tip}
Remember, contravariance is about inputting data. When you see the `in` keyword, think about consuming or taking in values, aligning with input parameters.
```

```{seealso}
We don't actually have to build an interface like `IComparer<T>` since .NET already contains a better implementation with the same name ðŸ¤“.
```

## Conclusion

By understanding and leveraging covariance and contravariance in generic interfaces, we can write code that is both type-safe and flexible. It allows us to build systems that can evolve over time without extensive refactoring, saving both time and effort.

```{tip}
Remember, `out` is for covariant output, while `in` is for contravariant input.
```
