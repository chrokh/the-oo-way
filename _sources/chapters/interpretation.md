```{warning}
This chapter is a work in progress.
```

- Contrast to compilation [{numref}`Chapter %s<compilation>`].
- Still needs to produce code for the layers below.
- Compilation errors are instead discovered at runtime.
- Regular runtime errors can still happen. See [{numref}`Chapter %s<execution>].
- Examples of languages
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - JavaScript
